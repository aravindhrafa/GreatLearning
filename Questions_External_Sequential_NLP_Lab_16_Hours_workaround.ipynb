His courtiers had all\\ntaken their leave of him, bowing their heads to the ground, according to\\nthe ceremonious usage of the day, and had retired to the Great Hall of\\nthe Palace, to receive a few last lessons from the Professor of\\nEtiquette; there being some of them who had still quite natural manners,\\nwhich in a courtier is, I need hardly say, a very grave offence.\\n\\nThe lad—for he was only a lad, being but sixteen years of age—was not\\nsorry at their departure, and had flung himself back with a deep sigh of\\nrelief on the soft cushions of his embroidered couch, lying there,\\nwild-eyed and open-mouthed, like a brown woodland Faun, or some young\\nanimal of the forest newly snared by the hunters.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, it was the hunters who had found him, coming upon him almost\\nby chance as, bare-limbed and pipe in hand, he was following the flock of\\nthe poor goatherd who had brought him up, and whose son he had always\\nfancied himself to be.  The child of the old King’s only daughter by a\\nsecret marriage with one much beneath her in station—a stranger, some\\nsaid, who, by the wonderful magic of his lute-playing, had made the young\\nPrincess love him; while others spoke of an artist from Rimini, to whom\\nthe Princess had shown much, perhaps too much honour, and who had\\nsuddenly disappeared from the city, leaving his work in the Cathedral\\nunfinished—he had been, when but a week old, stolen away from his\\nmother’s side, as she slept, and given into the charge of a common\\npeasant and his wife, who were without children of their own, and lived\\nin a remote part of the forest, more than a day’s ride from the town.\\nGrief, or the plague, as the court physician stated, or, as some\\nsuggested, a swift Italian poison administered in a cup of spiced wine,\\nslew, within an hour of her wakening, the white girl who had given him\\nbirth, and as the trusty messenger who bare the child across his\\nsaddle-bow stooped from his weary horse and knocked at the rude door of\\nthe goatherd’s hut, the body of the Princess was being lowered into an\\nopen grave that had been dug in a deserted churchyard, beyond the city\\ngates, a grave where it was said that another body was also lying, that\\nof a young man of marvellous and foreign beauty, whose hands were tied\\nbehind him with a knotted cord, and whose breast was stabbed with many\\nred wounds.\\n\\nSuch, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other.  Certain\\nit was that the old King, when on his deathbed, whether moved by remorse\\nfor his great sin, or merely desiring that the kingdom should not pass\\naway from his line, had had the lad sent for, and, in the presence of the\\nCouncil, had acknowledged him as his heir.\\n\\nAnd it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition he had\\nshown signs of that strange passion for beauty that was destined to have\\nso great an influence over his life.  Those who accompanied him to the\\nsuite of rooms set apart for his service, often spoke of the cry of\\npleasure that broke from his lips when he saw the delicate raiment and\\nrich jewels that had been prepared for him, and of the almost fierce joy\\nwith which he flung aside his rough leathern tunic and coarse sheepskin\\ncloak.  He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life,\\nand was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied\\nso much of each day, but the wonderful palace—_Joyeuse_, as they called\\nit—of which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world\\nfresh-fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the\\ncouncil-board or audience-chamber, he would run down the great staircase,\\nwith its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and\\nwander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was\\nseeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration\\nfrom sickness.\\n\\nUpon these journeys of discovery, as he would call them—and, indeed, they\\nwere to him real voyages through a marvellous land, he would sometimes be\\naccompanied by the slim, fair-haired Court pages, with their floating\\nmantles, and gay fluttering ribands; but more often he would be alone,\\nfeeling through a certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination,\\nthat the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like\\nWisdom, loves the lonely worshipper.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nMany curious stories were related about him at this period.  It was said\\nthat a stout Burgo-master, who had come to deliver a florid oratorical\\naddress on behalf of the citizens of the town, had caught sight of him\\nkneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been\\nbrought from Venice, and that seemed to herald the worship of some new\\ngods.  On another occasion he had been missed for several hours, and\\nafter a lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one\\nof the northern turrets of the palace gazing, as one in a trance, at a\\nGreek gem carved with the figure of Adonis.  He had been seen, so the\\ntale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an antique statue\\nthat had been discovered in the bed of the river on the occasion of the\\nbuilding of the stone bridge, and was inscribed with the name of the\\nBithynian slave of Hadrian.  He had passed a whole night in noting the\\neffect of the moonlight on a silver image of Endymion.\\n\\nAll rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him,\\nand in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants,\\nsome to traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of the north seas,\\nsome to Egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found\\nonly in the tombs of kings, and is said to possess magical properties,\\nsome to Persia for silken carpets and painted pottery, and others to\\nIndia to buy gauze and stained ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade,\\nsandal-wood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool.\\n\\nBut what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his\\ncoronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded crown, and the\\nsceptre with its rows and rings of pearls.  Indeed, it was of this that\\nhe was thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching\\nthe great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth.\\nThe designs, which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the\\ntime, had been submitted to him many months before, and he had given\\norders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out,\\nand that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be\\nworthy of their work.  He saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar\\nof the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and a smile played and\\nlingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with a bright lustre his dark\\nwoodland eyes.\\n\\nAfter some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved\\npenthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room.  The walls\\nwere hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty.  A\\nlarge press, inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and\\nfacing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels\\nof powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets\\nof Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx.  Pale poppies were\\nbroidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from\\nthe tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the\\nvelvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like\\nwhite foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling.  A laughing\\nNarcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head.  On the\\ntable stood a flat bowl of amethyst.\\n\\nOutside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a\\nbubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and\\ndown on the misty terrace by the river.  Far away, in an orchard, a\\nnightingale was singing.  A faint perfume of jasmine came through the\\nopen window.  He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and\\ntaking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords.  His heavy\\neyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him.  Never before had\\nhe felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and the mystery\\nof beautiful things.\\n\\nWhen midnight sounded from the clock-tower he touched a bell, and his\\npages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose-water\\nover his hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow.  A few moments after\\nthat they had left the room, he fell asleep.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd as he slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the whir and\\nclatter of many looms.  The meagre daylight peered in through the grated\\nwindows, and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers bending over\\ntheir cases.  Pale, sickly-looking children were crouched on the huge\\ncrossbeams.  As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the\\nheavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall\\nand pressed the threads together.  Their faces were pinched with famine,\\nand their thin hands shook and trembled.  Some haggard women were seated\\nat a table sewing.  A horrible odour filled the place.  The air was foul\\nand heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp.\\n\\nThe young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him and\\nwatched him.\\n\\nAnd the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, ‘Why art thou watching\\nme?  Art thou a spy set on us by our master?’\\n\\n‘Who is thy master?’ asked the young King.\\n\\n‘Our master!’ cried the weaver, bitterly.  ‘He is a man like myself.\\nIndeed, there is but this difference between us—that he wears fine\\nclothes while I go in rags, and that while I am weak from hunger he\\nsuffers not a little from overfeeding.’\\n\\n‘The land is free,’ said the young King, ‘and thou art no man’s slave.’\\n\\n‘In war,’ answered the weaver, ‘the strong make slaves of the weak, and\\nin peace the rich make slaves of the poor.  We must work to live, and\\nthey give us such mean wages that we die.  We toil for them all day long,\\nand they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before\\ntheir time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil.  We\\ntread out the grapes, and another drinks the wine.  We sow the corn, and\\nour own board is empty.  We have chains, though no eye beholds them; and\\nare slaves, though men call us free.’\\n\\n‘Is it so with all?’ he asked,\\n\\n‘It is so with all,’ answered the weaver, ‘with the young as well as with\\nthe old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little children\\nas well as with those who are stricken in years.  The merchants grind us\\ndown, and we must needs do their bidding.  The priest rides by and tells\\nhis beads, and no man has care of us.  Through our sunless lanes creeps\\nPoverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close\\nbehind her.  Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at\\nnight.  But what are these things to thee?  Thou art not one of us.  Thy\\nface is too happy.’  And he turned away scowling, and threw the shuttle\\nacross the loom, and the young King saw that it was threaded with a\\nthread of gold.\\n\\nAnd a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, ‘What robe\\nis this that thou art weaving?’\\n\\n‘It is the robe for the coronation of the young King,’ he answered; ‘what\\nis that to thee?’\\n\\nAnd the young King gave a loud cry and woke, and lo! he was in his own\\nchamber, and through the window he saw the great honey-coloured moon\\nhanging in the dusky air.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that was being\\nrowed by a hundred slaves.  On a carpet by his side the master of the\\ngalley was seated.  He was black as ebony, and his turban was of crimson\\nsilk.  Great earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears,\\nand in his hands he had a pair of ivory scales.\\n\\nThe slaves were naked, but for a ragged loin-cloth, and each man was\\nchained to his neighbour.  The hot sun beat brightly upon them, and the\\nnegroes ran up and down the gangway and lashed them with whips of hide.\\nThey stretched out their lean arms and pulled the heavy oars through the\\nwater.  The salt spray flew from the blades.\\n\\nAt last they reached a little bay, and began to take soundings.  A light\\nwind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail\\nwith a fine red dust.  Three Arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and\\nthrew spears at them.  The master of the galley took a painted bow in his\\nhand and shot one of them in the throat.  He fell heavily into the surf,\\nand his companions galloped away.  A woman wrapped in a yellow veil\\nfollowed slowly on a camel, looking back now and then at the dead body.\\n\\nAs soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail, the negroes\\nwent into the hold and brought up a long rope-ladder, heavily weighted\\nwith lead.  The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the\\nends fast to two iron stanchions.  Then the negroes seized the youngest\\nof the slaves and knocked his gyves off, and filled his nostrils and his\\nears with wax, and tied a big stone round his waist.  He crept wearily\\ndown the ladder, and disappeared into the sea.  A few bubbles rose where\\nhe sank.  Some of the other slaves peered curiously over the side.  At\\nthe prow of the galley sat a shark-charmer, beating monotonously upon a\\ndrum.\\n\\nAfter some time the diver rose up out of the water, and clung panting to\\nthe ladder with a pearl in his right hand.  The negroes seized it from\\nhim, and thrust him back.  The slaves fell asleep over their oars.\\n\\nAgain and again he came up, and each time that he did so he brought with\\nhim a beautiful pearl.  The master of the galley weighed them, and put\\nthem into a little bag of green leather.\\n\\nThe young King tried to speak, but his tongue seemed to cleave to the\\nroof of his mouth, and his lips refused to move.  The negroes chattered\\nto each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads.  Two\\ncranes flew round and round the vessel.\\n\\nThen the diver came up for the last time, and the pearl that he brought\\nwith him was fairer than all the pearls of Ormuz, for it was shaped like\\nthe full moon, and whiter than the morning star.  But his face was\\nstrangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his\\nears and nostrils.  He quivered for a little, and then he was still.  The\\nnegroes shrugged their shoulders, and threw the body overboard.\\n\\nAnd the master of the galley laughed, and, reaching out, he took the\\npearl, and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed.  ‘It\\nshall be,’ he said, ‘for the sceptre of the young King,’ and he made a\\nsign to the negroes to draw up the anchor.\\n\\nAnd when the young King heard this he gave a great cry, and woke, and\\nthrough the window he saw the long grey fingers of the dawn clutching at\\nthe fading stars.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd he fell asleep again, and dreamed, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was wandering through a dim wood, hung with strange\\nfruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers.  The adders hissed at him as\\nhe went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch.\\nHuge tortoises lay asleep upon the hot mud.  The trees were full of apes\\nand peacocks.\\n\\nOn and on he went, till he reached the outskirts of the wood, and there\\nhe saw an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of a dried-up\\nriver.  They swarmed up the crag like ants.  They dug deep pits in the\\nground and went down into them.  Some of them cleft the rocks with great\\naxes; others grabbled in the sand.\\n\\nThey tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet\\nblossoms.  They hurried about, calling to each other, and no man was\\nidle.\\n\\nFrom the darkness of a cavern Death and Avarice watched them, and Death\\nsaid, ‘I am weary; give me a third of them and let me go.’  But Avarice\\nshook her head.  ‘They are my servants,’ she answered.\\n\\nAnd Death said to her, ‘What hast thou in thy hand?’\\n\\n‘I have three grains of corn,’ she answered; ‘what is that to thee?’\\n\\n‘Give me one of them,’ cried Death, ‘to plant in my garden; only one of\\nthem, and I will go away.’\\n\\n‘I will not give thee anything,’ said Avarice, and she hid her hand in\\nthe fold of her raiment.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of water,\\nand out of the cup rose Ague.  She passed through the great multitude,\\nand a third of them lay dead.  A cold mist followed her, and the\\nwater-snakes ran by her side.\\n\\nAnd when Avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she beat her\\nbreast and wept.  She beat her barren bosom, and cried aloud.  ‘Thou hast\\nslain a third of my servants,’ she cried, ‘get thee gone.  There is war\\nin the mountains of Tartary, and the kings of each side are calling to\\nthee.  The Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle.\\nThey have beaten upon their shields with their spears, and have put on\\ntheir helmets of iron.  What is my valley to thee, that thou shouldst\\ntarry in it?  Get thee gone, and come here no more.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ answered Death, ‘but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I\\nwill not go.’\\n\\nBut Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth.  ‘I will not give thee\\nanything,’ she muttered.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into the\\nforest, and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of\\nflame.  She passed through the multitude, and touched them, and each man\\nthat she touched died.  The grass withered beneath her feet as she\\nwalked.\\n\\nAnd Avarice shuddered, and put ashes on her head.  ‘Thou art cruel,’ she\\ncried; ‘thou art cruel.  There is famine in the walled cities of India,\\nand the cisterns of Samarcand have run dry.  There is famine in the\\nwalled cities of Egypt, and the locusts have come up from the desert.\\nThe Nile has not overflowed its banks, and the priests have cursed Isis\\nand Osiris.  Get thee gone to those who need thee, and leave me my\\nservants.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ answered Death, ‘but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I\\nwill not go.’\\n\\n‘I will not give thee anything,’ said Avarice.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed again, and he whistled through his fingers, and a woman\\ncame flying through the air.  Plague was written upon her forehead, and a\\ncrowd of lean vultures wheeled round her.  She covered the valley with\\nher wings, and no man was left alive.\\n\\nAnd Avarice fled shrieking through the forest, and Death leaped upon his\\nred horse and galloped away, and his galloping was faster than the wind.\\n\\nAnd out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons and\\nhorrible things with scales, and the jackals came trotting along the\\nsand, sniffing up the air with their nostrils.\\n\\nAnd the young King wept, and said: ‘Who were these men, and for what were\\nthey seeking?’\\n\\n‘For rubies for a king’s crown,’ answered one who stood behind him.\\n\\nAnd the young King started, and, turning round, he saw a man habited as a\\npilgrim and holding in his hand a mirror of silver.\\n\\nAnd he grew pale, and said: ‘For what king?’\\n\\nAnd the pilgrim answered: ‘Look in this mirror, and thou shalt see him.’\\n\\nAnd he looked in the mirror, and, seeing his own face, he gave a great\\ncry and woke, and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and\\nfrom the trees of the garden and pleasaunce the birds were singing.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Chamberlain and the high officers of State came in and made\\nobeisance to him, and the pages brought him the robe of tissued gold, and\\nset the crown and the sceptre before him.\\n\\nAnd the young King looked at them, and they were beautiful.  More\\nbeautiful were they than aught that he had ever seen.  But he remembered\\nhis dreams, and he said to his lords: ‘Take these things away, for I will\\nnot wear them.’\\n\\nAnd the courtiers were amazed, and some of them laughed, for they thought\\nthat he was jesting.\\n\\nBut he spake sternly to them again, and said: ‘Take these things away,\\nand hide them from me.  Though it be the day of my coronation, I will not\\nwear them.  For on the loom of Sorrow, and by the white hands of Pain,\\nhas this my robe been woven.  There is Blood in the heart of the ruby,\\nand Death in the heart of the pearl.’  And he told them his three dreams.\\n\\nAnd when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and\\nwhispered, saying: ‘Surely he is mad; for what is a dream but a dream,\\nand a vision but a vision?  They are not real things that one should heed\\nthem.  And what have we to do with the lives of those who toil for us?\\nShall a man not eat bread till he has seen the sower, nor drink wine till\\nhe has talked with the vinedresser?’\\n\\nAnd the Chamberlain spake to the young King, and said, ‘My lord, I pray\\nthee set aside these black thoughts of thine, and put on this fair robe,\\nand set this crown upon thy head.  For how shall the people know that\\nthou art a king, if thou hast not a king’s raiment?’\\n\\nAnd the young King looked at him.  ‘Is it so, indeed?’ he questioned.\\n‘Will they not know me for a king if I have not a king’s raiment?’\\n\\n‘They will not know thee, my lord,’ cried the Chamberlain.\\n\\n‘I had thought that there had been men who were kinglike,’ he answered,\\n‘but it may be as thou sayest.  And yet I will not wear this robe, nor\\nwill I be crowned with this crown, but even as I came to the palace so\\nwill I go forth from it.’\\n\\nAnd he bade them all leave him, save one page whom he kept as his\\ncompanion, a lad a year younger than himself.  Him he kept for his\\nservice, and when he had bathed himself in clear water, he opened a great\\npainted chest, and from it he took the leathern tunic and rough sheepskin\\ncloak that he had worn when he had watched on the hillside the shaggy\\ngoats of the goatherd.  These he put on, and in his hand he took his rude\\nshepherd’s staff.\\n\\nAnd the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling\\nto him, ‘My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy\\ncrown?’\\n\\nAnd the young King plucked a spray of wild briar that was climbing over\\nthe balcony, and bent it, and made a circlet of it, and set it on his own\\nhead.\\n\\n‘This shall he my crown,’ he answered.\\n\\nAnd thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the Great Hall, where\\nthe nobles were waiting for him.\\n\\nAnd the nobles made merry, and some of them cried out to him, ‘My lord,\\nthe people wait for their king, and thou showest them a beggar,’ and\\nothers were wroth and said, ‘He brings shame upon our state, and is\\nunworthy to be our master.’  But he answered them not a word, but passed\\non, and went down the bright porphyry staircase, and out through the\\ngates of bronze, and mounted upon his horse, and rode towards the\\ncathedral, the little page running beside him.\\n\\nAnd the people laughed and said, ‘It is the King’s fool who is riding\\nby,’ and they mocked him.\\n\\nAnd he drew rein and said, ‘Nay, but I am the King.’  And he told them\\nhis three dreams.\\n\\nAnd a man came out of the crowd and spake bitterly to him, and said,\\n‘Sir, knowest thou not that out of the luxury of the rich cometh the life\\nof the poor?  By your pomp we are nurtured, and your vices give us bread.\\nTo toil for a hard master is bitter, but to have no master to toil for is\\nmore bitter still.  Thinkest thou that the ravens will feed us?  And what\\ncure hast thou for these things?  Wilt thou say to the buyer, “Thou shalt\\nbuy for so much,” and to the seller, “Thou shalt sell at this price”?  I\\ntrow not.  Therefore go back to thy Palace and put on thy purple and fine\\nlinen.  What hast thou to do with us, and what we suffer?’\\n\\n‘Are not the rich and the poor brothers?’ asked the young King.\\n\\n‘Ay,’ answered the man, ‘and the name of the rich brother is Cain.’\\n\\nAnd the young King’s eyes filled with tears, and he rode on through the\\nmurmurs of the people, and the little page grew afraid and left him.\\n\\nAnd when he reached the great portal of the cathedral, the soldiers\\nthrust their halberts out and said, ‘What dost thou seek here?  None\\nenters by this door but the King.’\\n\\nAnd his face flushed with anger, and he said to them, ‘I am the King,’\\nand waved their halberts aside and passed in.\\n\\nAnd when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd’s dress, he rose\\nup in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, ‘My\\nson, is this a king’s apparel?  And with what crown shall I crown thee,\\nand what sceptre shall I place in thy hand?  Surely this should be to\\nthee a day of joy, and not a day of abasement.’\\n\\n‘Shall Joy wear what Grief has fashioned?’ said the young King.  And he\\ntold him his three dreams.\\n\\nAnd when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, ‘My son,\\nI am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil\\nthings are done in the wide world.  The fierce robbers come down from the\\nmountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors.\\nThe lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels.  The\\nwild boar roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines\\nupon the hill.  The pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the ships of\\nthe fishermen, and take their nets from them.  In the salt-marshes live\\nthe lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh\\nthem.  The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the\\ndogs.  Canst thou make these things not to be?  Wilt thou take the leper\\nfor thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board?  Shall the lion do\\nthy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee?  Is not He who made misery\\nwiser than thou art?  Wherefore I praise thee not for this that thou hast\\ndone, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad, and\\nput on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I\\nwill crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand.  And\\nas for thy dreams, think no more of them.  The burden of this world is\\ntoo great for one man to bear, and the world’s sorrow too heavy for one\\nheart to suffer.’\\n\\n‘Sayest thou that in this house?’ said the young King, and he strode past\\nthe Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood before the\\nimage of Christ.\\n\\nHe stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and on his\\nleft were the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with the yellow\\nwine, and the vial with the holy oil.  He knelt before the image of\\nChrist, and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine, and\\nthe smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome.\\nHe bowed his head in prayer, and the priests in their stiff copes crept\\naway from the altar.\\n\\nAnd suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered\\nthe nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished\\nsteel.  ‘Where is this dreamer of dreams?’ they cried.  ‘Where is this\\nKing who is apparelled like a beggar—this boy who brings shame upon our\\nstate?  Surely we will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.’\\n\\nAnd the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he had\\nfinished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at them\\nsadly.\\n\\nAnd lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him,\\nand the sun-beams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the\\nrobe that had been fashioned for his pleasure.  The dead staff blossomed,\\nand bare lilies that were whiter than pearls.  The dry thorn blossomed,\\nand bare roses that were redder than rubies.  Whiter than fine pearls\\nwere the lilies, and their stems were of bright silver.  Redder than male\\nrubies were the roses, and their leaves were of beaten gold.\\n\\nHe stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the jewelled\\nshrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed monstrance shone\\na marvellous and mystical light.  He stood there in a king’s raiment, and\\nthe Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches\\nseemed to move.  In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and\\nthe organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their\\ntrumpets, and the singing boys sang.\\n\\nAnd the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles sheathed\\ntheir swords and did homage, and the Bishop’s face grew pale, and his\\nhands trembled.  ‘A greater than I hath crowned thee,’ he cried, and he\\nknelt before him.\\n\\nAnd the young King came down from the high altar, and passed home through\\nthe midst of the people.  But no man dared look upon his face, for it was\\nlike the face of an angel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BIRTHDAY OF THE INFANTA\\n\\n\\n                                    TO\\n                         MRS. WILLIAM H. GRENFELL\\n                             OF TAPLOW COURT\\n                            [LADY DESBOROUGH]\\n\\nIT was the birthday of the Infanta.  She was just twelve years of age,\\nand the sun was shining brightly in the gardens of the palace.\\n\\nAlthough she was a real Princess and the Infanta of Spain, she had only\\none birthday every year, just like the children of quite poor people, so\\nit was naturally a matter of great importance to the whole country that\\nshe should have a really fine day for the occasion.  And a really fine\\nday it certainly was.  The tall striped tulips stood straight up upon\\ntheir stalks, like long rows of soldiers, and looked defiantly across the\\ngrass at the roses, and said: ‘We are quite as splendid as you are now.’\\nThe purple butterflies fluttered about with gold dust on their wings,\\nvisiting each flower in turn; the little lizards crept out of the\\ncrevices of the wall, and lay basking in the white glare; and the\\npomegranates split and cracked with the heat, and showed their bleeding\\nred hearts.  Even the pale yellow lemons, that hung in such profusion\\nfrom the mouldering trellis and along the dim arcades, seemed to have\\ncaught a richer colour from the wonderful sunlight, and the magnolia\\ntrees opened their great globe-like blossoms of folded ivory, and filled\\nthe air with a sweet heavy perfume.\\n\\nThe little Princess herself walked up and down the terrace with her\\ncompanions, and played at hide and seek round the stone vases and the old\\nmoss-grown statues.  On ordinary days she was only allowed to play with\\nchildren of her own rank, so she had always to play alone, but her\\nbirthday was an exception, and the King had given orders that she was to\\ninvite any of her young friends whom she liked to come and amuse\\nthemselves with her.  There was a stately grace about these slim Spanish\\nchildren as they glided about, the boys with their large-plumed hats and\\nshort fluttering cloaks, the girls holding up the trains of their long\\nbrocaded gowns, and shielding the sun from their eyes with huge fans of\\nblack and silver.  But the Infanta was the most graceful of all, and the\\nmost tastefully attired, after the somewhat cumbrous fashion of the day.\\nHer robe was of grey satin, the skirt and the wide puffed sleeves heavily\\nembroidered with silver, and the stiff corset studded with rows of fine\\npearls.  Two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her\\ndress as she walked.  Pink and pearl was her great gauze fan, and in her\\nhair, which like an aureole of faded gold stood out stiffly round her\\npale little face, she had a beautiful white rose.\\n\\nFrom a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them.  Behind\\nhim stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his\\nconfessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side.  Sadder even\\nthan usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta bowing with\\nchildish gravity to the assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan\\nat the grim Duchess of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought\\nof the young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before—so it seemed\\nto him—had come from the gay country of France, and had withered away in\\nthe sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six months after\\nthe birth of her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice\\nin the orchard, or plucked the second year’s fruit from the old gnarled\\nfig-tree that stood in the centre of the now grass-grown courtyard.  So\\ngreat had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave\\nto hide her from him.  She had been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who\\nin return for this service had been granted his life, which for heresy\\nand suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited, men said,\\nto the Holy Office, and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier\\nin the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as the monks had borne her\\nin on that windy March day nearly twelve years before.  Once every month\\nthe King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand,\\nwent in and knelt by her side calling out, ‘_Mi reina_!  _Mi reina_!’ and\\nsometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs\\nevery separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a\\nKing, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of\\ngrief, and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face.\\n\\nTo-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at the Castle\\nof Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age, and she still\\nyounger.  They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal\\nNuncio in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had\\nreturned to the Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow\\nhair, and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand\\nas he stepped into his carriage.  Later on had followed the marriage,\\nhastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two\\ncountries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary\\ncelebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than\\nusually solemn _auto-da-fé_, in which nearly three hundred heretics,\\namongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular\\narm to be burned.\\n\\nCertainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his\\ncountry, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the\\nNew World.  He had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for\\nher, he had forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs of\\nState; and, with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its\\nservants, he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which\\nhe sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which\\nshe suffered.  When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft of\\nreason.  Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would have formally\\nabdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at Granada, of\\nwhich he was already titular Prior, had he not been afraid to leave the\\nlittle Infanta at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain,\\nwas notorious, and who was suspected by many of having caused the Queen’s\\ndeath by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her\\non the occasion of her visiting his castle in Aragon.  Even after the\\nexpiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained\\nthroughout his whole dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his\\nministers to speak about any new alliance, and when the Emperor himself\\nsent to him, and offered him the hand of the lovely Archduchess of\\nBohemia, his niece, in marriage, he bade the ambassadors tell their\\nmaster that the King of Spain was already wedded to Sorrow, and that\\nthough she was but a barren bride he loved her better than Beauty; an\\nanswer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the Netherlands, which\\nsoon after, at the Emperor’s instigation, revolted against him under the\\nleadership of some fanatics of the Reformed Church.\\n\\nHis whole married life, with its fierce, fiery-coloured joys and the\\nterrible agony of its sudden ending, seemed to come back to him to-day as\\nhe watched the Infanta playing on the terrace.  She had all the Queen’s\\npretty petulance of manner, the same wilful way of tossing her head, the\\nsame proud curved beautiful mouth, the same wonderful smile—_vrai sourire\\nde France_ indeed—as she glanced up now and then at the window, or\\nstretched out her little hand for the stately Spanish gentlemen to kiss.\\nBut the shrill laughter of the children grated on his ears, and the\\nbright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow, and a dull odour of strange\\nspices, spices such as embalmers use, seemed to taint—or was it\\nfancy?—the clear morning air.  He buried his face in his hands, and when\\nthe Infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn, and the King had\\nretired.\\n\\nShe made a little _moue_ of disappointment, and shrugged her shoulders.\\nSurely he might have stayed with her on her birthday.  What did the\\nstupid State-affairs matter?  Or had he gone to that gloomy chapel, where\\nthe candles were always burning, and where she was never allowed to\\nenter?  How silly of him, when the sun was shining so brightly, and\\neverybody was so happy!  Besides, he would miss the sham bull-fight for\\nwhich the trumpet was already sounding, to say nothing of the puppet-show\\nand the other wonderful things.  Her uncle and the Grand Inquisitor were\\nmuch more sensible.  They had come out on the terrace, and paid her nice\\ncompliments.  So she tossed her pretty head, and taking Don Pedro by the\\nhand, she walked slowly down the steps towards a long pavilion of purple\\nsilk that had been erected at the end of the garden, the other children\\nfollowing in strict order of precedence, those who had the longest names\\ngoing first.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nA procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed as _toreadors_, came\\nout to meet her, and the young Count of Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully\\nhandsome lad of about fourteen years of age, uncovering his head with all\\nthe grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to\\na little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the\\narena.  The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big\\nfans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor\\nstood laughing at the entrance.  Even the Duchess—the Camerera-Mayor as\\nshe was called—a thin, hard-featured woman with a yellow ruff, did not\\nlook quite so bad-tempered as usual, and something like a chill smile\\nflitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips.\\n\\nIt certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer, the Infanta\\nthought, than the real bull-fight that she had been brought to see at\\nSeville, on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of Parma to her father.\\nSome of the boys pranced about on richly-caparisoned hobby-horses\\nbrandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached\\nto them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull,\\nand vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for\\nthe bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made\\nof wicker-work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running\\nround the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of\\ndoing.  He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children got so\\nexcited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace\\nhandkerchiefs and cried out: _Bravo toro_!  _Bravo toro_! just as\\nsensibly as if they had been grown-up people.  At last, however, after a\\nprolonged combat, during which several of the hobby-horses were gored\\nthrough and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of\\nTierra-Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained\\npermission from the Infanta to give the _coup de grâce_, he plunged his\\nwooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head\\ncame right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de\\nLorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.\\n\\nThe arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead\\nhobby-horses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and\\nblack liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a French\\nposture-master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets\\nappeared in the semi-classical tragedy of _Sophonisba_ on the stage of a\\nsmall theatre that had been built up for the purpose.  They acted so\\nwell, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of\\nthe play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears.  Indeed some\\nof the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats,\\nand the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help\\nsaying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made\\nsimply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires,\\nshould be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.\\n\\nAn African juggler followed, who brought in a large flat basket covered\\nwith a red cloth, and having placed it in the centre of the arena, he\\ntook from his turban a curious reed pipe, and blew through it.  In a few\\nmoments the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and\\nshriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange wedge-shaped\\nheads and rose slowly up, swaying to and fro with the music as a plant\\nsways in the water.  The children, however, were rather frightened at\\ntheir spotted hoods and quick darting tongues, and were much more pleased\\nwhen the juggler made a tiny orange-tree grow out of the sand and bear\\npretty white blossoms and clusters of real fruit; and when he took the\\nfan of the little daughter of the Marquess de Las-Torres, and changed it\\ninto a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and sang, their delight\\nand amazement knew no bounds.  The solemn minuet, too, performed by the\\ndancing boys from the church of Nuestra Senora Del Pilar, was charming.\\nThe Infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes\\nplace every year at Maytime in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and\\nin her honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had entered\\nthe great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by many to\\nhave been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a\\npoisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias.  So she had known only by\\nhearsay of ‘Our Lady’s Dance,’ as it was called, and it certainly was a\\nbeautiful sight.  The boys wore old-fashioned court dresses of white\\nvelvet, and their curious three-cornered hats were fringed with silver\\nand surmounted with huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling\\nwhiteness of their costumes, as they moved about in the sunlight, being\\nstill more accentuated by their swarthy faces and long black hair.\\nEverybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved\\nthrough the intricate figures of the dance, and by the elaborate grace of\\ntheir slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they had finished their\\nperformance and doffed their great plumed hats to the Infanta, she\\nacknowledged their reverence with much courtesy, and made a vow that she\\nwould send a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar in\\nreturn for the pleasure that she had given her.\\n\\nA troop of handsome Egyptians—as the gipsies were termed in those\\ndays—then advanced into the arena, and sitting down cross-legs, in a\\ncircle, began to play softly upon their zithers, moving their bodies to\\nthe tune, and humming, almost below their breath, a low dreamy air.  When\\nthey caught sight of Don Pedro they scowled at him, and some of them\\nlooked terrified, for only a few weeks before he had had two of their\\ntribe hanged for sorcery in the market-place at Seville, but the pretty\\nInfanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her\\ngreat blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could\\nnever be cruel to anybody.  So they played on very gently and just\\ntouching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails, and\\ntheir heads began to nod as though they were falling asleep.  Suddenly,\\nwith a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and Don Pedro’s\\nhand clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger, they leapt to their feet\\nand whirled madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines, and\\nchaunting some wild love-song in their strange guttural language.  Then\\nat another signal they all flung themselves again to the ground and lay\\nthere quite still, the dull strumming of the zithers being the only sound\\nthat broke the silence.  After that they had done this several times,\\nthey disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown shaggy bear\\nby a chain, and carrying on their shoulders some little Barbary apes.\\nThe bear stood upon his head with the utmost gravity, and the wizened\\napes played all kinds of amusing tricks with two gipsy boys who seemed to\\nbe their masters, and fought with tiny swords, and fired off guns, and\\nwent through a regular soldier’s drill just like the King’s own\\nbodyguard.  In fact the gipsies were a great success.\\n\\nBut the funniest part of the whole morning’s entertainment, was\\nundoubtedly the dancing of the little Dwarf.  When he stumbled into the\\narena, waddling on his crooked legs and wagging his huge misshapen head\\nfrom side to side, the children went off into a loud shout of delight,\\nand the Infanta herself laughed so much that the Camerera was obliged to\\nremind her that although there were many precedents in Spain for a King’s\\ndaughter weeping before her equals, there were none for a Princess of the\\nblood royal making so merry before those who were her inferiors in birth.\\nThe Dwarf, however, was really quite irresistible, and even at the\\nSpanish Court, always noted for its cultivated passion for the horrible,\\nso fantastic a little monster had never been seen.  It was his first\\nappearance, too.  He had been discovered only the day before, running\\nwild through the forest, by two of the nobles who happened to have been\\nhunting in a remote part of the great cork-wood that surrounded the town,\\nand had been carried off by them to the Palace as a surprise for the\\nInfanta; his father, who was a poor charcoal-burner, being but too well\\npleased to get rid of so ugly and useless a child.  Perhaps the most\\namusing thing about him was his complete unconsciousness of his own\\ngrotesque appearance.  Indeed he seemed quite happy and full of the\\nhighest spirits.  When the children laughed, he laughed as freely and as\\njoyously as any of them, and at the close of each dance he made them each\\nthe funniest of bows, smiling and nodding at them just as if he was\\nreally one of themselves, and not a little misshapen thing that Nature,\\nin some humourous mood, had fashioned for others to mock at.  As for the\\nInfanta, she absolutely fascinated him.  He could not keep his eyes off\\nher, and seemed to dance for her alone, and when at the close of the\\nperformance, remembering how she had seen the great ladies of the Court\\nthrow bouquets to Caffarelli, the famous Italian treble, whom the Pope\\nhad sent from his own chapel to Madrid that he might cure the King’s\\nmelancholy by the sweetness of his voice, she took out of her hair the\\nbeautiful white rose, and partly for a jest and partly to tease the\\nCamerera, threw it to him across the arena with her sweetest smile, he\\ntook the whole matter quite seriously, and pressing the flower to his\\nrough coarse lips he put his hand upon his heart, and sank on one knee\\nbefore her, grinning from ear to ear, and with his little bright eyes\\nsparkling with pleasure.\\n\\nThis so upset the gravity of the Infanta that she kept on laughing long\\nafter the little Dwarf had ran out of the arena, and expressed a desire\\nto her uncle that the dance should be immediately repeated.  The\\nCamerera, however, on the plea that the sun was too hot, decided that it\\nwould be better that her Highness should return without delay to the\\nPalace, where a wonderful feast had been already prepared for her,\\nincluding a real birthday cake with her own initials worked all over it\\nin painted sugar and a lovely silver flag waving from the top.  The\\nInfanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given orders\\nthat the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of\\nsiesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of Tierra-Nueva for\\nhis charming reception, she went back to her apartments, the children\\nfollowing in the same order in which they had entered.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before\\nthe Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so proud that he ran\\nout into the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of\\npleasure, and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight.\\n\\nThe Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their\\nbeautiful home, and when they saw him capering up and down the walks, and\\nwaving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could\\nnot restrain their feelings any longer.\\n\\n‘He is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any place where we\\nare,’ cried the Tulips.\\n\\n‘He should drink poppy-juice, and go to sleep for a thousand years,’ said\\nthe great scarlet Lilies, and they grew quite hot and angry.\\n\\n‘He is a perfect horror!’ screamed the Cactus.  ‘Why, he is twisted and\\nstumpy, and his head is completely out of proportion with his legs.\\nReally he makes me feel prickly all over, and if he comes near me I will\\nsting him with my thorns.’\\n\\n‘And he has actually got one of my best blooms,’ exclaimed the White\\nRose-Tree.  ‘I gave it to the Infanta this morning myself, as a birthday\\npresent, and he has stolen it from her.’  And she called out: ‘Thief,\\nthief, thief!’ at the top of her voice.\\n\\nEven the red Geraniums, who did not usually give themselves airs, and\\nwere known to have a great many poor relations themselves, curled up in\\ndisgust when they saw him, and when the Violets meekly remarked that\\nthough he was certainly extremely plain, still he could not help it, they\\nretorted with a good deal of justice that that was his chief defect, and\\nthat there was no reason why one should admire a person because he was\\nincurable; and, indeed, some of the Violets themselves felt that the\\nugliness of the little Dwarf was almost ostentatious, and that he would\\nhave shown much better taste if he had looked sad, or at least pensive,\\ninstead of jumping about merrily, and throwing himself into such\\ngrotesque and silly attitudes.\\n\\nAs for the old Sundial, who was an extremely remarkable individual, and\\nhad once told the time of day to no less a person than the Emperor\\nCharles V. himself, he was so taken aback by the little Dwarf’s\\nappearance, that he almost forgot to mark two whole minutes with his long\\nshadowy finger, and could not help saying to the great milk-white\\nPeacock, who was sunning herself on the balustrade, that every one knew\\nthat the children of Kings were Kings, and that the children of\\ncharcoal-burners were charcoal-burners, and that it was absurd to pretend\\nthat it wasn’t so; a statement with which the Peacock entirely agreed,\\nand indeed screamed out, ‘Certainly, certainly,’ in such a loud, harsh\\nvoice, that the gold-fish who lived in the basin of the cool splashing\\nfountain put their heads out of the water, and asked the huge stone\\nTritons what on earth was the matter.\\n\\nBut somehow the Birds liked him.  They had seen him often in the forest,\\ndancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or crouched up in the\\nhollow of some old oak-tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels.  They\\ndid not mind his being ugly, a bit.  Why, even the nightingale herself,\\nwho sang so sweetly in the orange groves at night that sometimes the Moon\\nleaned down to listen, was not much to look at after all; and, besides,\\nhe had been kind to them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when\\nthere were no berries on the trees, and the ground was as hard as iron,\\nand the wolves had come down to the very gates of the city to look for\\nfood, he had never once forgotten them, but had always given them crumbs\\nout of his little hunch of black bread, and divided with them whatever\\npoor breakfast he had.\\n\\nSo they flew round and round him, just touching his cheek with their\\nwings as they passed, and chattered to each other, and the little Dwarf\\nwas so pleased that he could not help showing them the beautiful white\\nrose, and telling them that the Infanta herself had given it to him\\nbecause she loved him.\\n\\nThey did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but that\\nmade no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and looked wise,\\nwhich is quite as good as understanding a thing, and very much easier.\\n\\nThe Lizards also took an immense fancy to him, and when he grew tired of\\nrunning about and flung himself down on the grass to rest, they played\\nand romped all over him, and tried to amuse him in the best way they\\ncould.  ‘Every one cannot be as beautiful as a lizard,’ they cried; ‘that\\nwould be too much to expect.  And, though it sounds absurd to say so, he\\nis really not so ugly after all, provided, of course, that one shuts\\none’s eyes, and does not look at him.’  The Lizards were extremely\\nphilosophical by nature, and often sat thinking for hours and hours\\ntogether, when there was nothing else to do, or when the weather was too\\nrainy for them to go out.\\n\\nThe Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their behaviour, and at\\nthe behaviour of the birds.  ‘It only shows,’ they said, ‘what a\\nvulgarising effect this incessant rushing and flying about has.\\nWell-bred people always stay exactly in the same place, as we do.  No one\\never saw us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the\\ngrass after dragon-flies.  When we do want change of air, we send for the\\ngardener, and he carries us to another bed.  This is dignified, and as it\\nshould be.  But birds and lizards have no sense of repose, and indeed\\nbirds have not even a permanent address.  They are mere vagrants like the\\ngipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.’  So they put\\ntheir noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted\\nwhen after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the\\ngrass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.\\n\\n‘He should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural life,’\\nthey said.  ‘Look at his hunched back, and his crooked legs,’ and they\\nbegan to titter.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf knew nothing of all this.  He liked the birds and\\nthe lizards immensely, and thought that the flowers were the most\\nmarvellous things in the whole world, except of course the Infanta, but\\nthen she had given him the beautiful white rose, and she loved him, and\\nthat made a great difference.  How he wished that he had gone back with\\nher!  She would have put him on her right hand, and smiled at him, and he\\nwould have never left her side, but would have made her his playmate, and\\ntaught her all kinds of delightful tricks.  For though he had never been\\nin a palace before, he knew a great many wonderful things.  He could make\\nlittle cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion\\nthe long jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear.  He knew\\nthe cry of every bird, and could call the starlings from the tree-top, or\\nthe heron from the mere.  He knew the trail of every animal, and could\\ntrack the hare by its delicate footprints, and the boar by the trampled\\nleaves.  All the wild-dances he knew, the mad dance in red raiment with\\nthe autumn, the light dance in blue sandals over the corn, the dance with\\nwhite snow-wreaths in winter, and the blossom-dance through the orchards\\nin spring.  He knew where the wood-pigeons built their nests, and once\\nwhen a fowler had snared the parent birds, he had brought up the young\\nones himself, and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a\\npollard elm.  They were quite tame, and used to feed out of his hands\\nevery morning.  She would like them, and the rabbits that scurried about\\nin the long fern, and the jays with their steely feathers and black\\nbills, and the hedgehogs that could curl themselves up into prickly\\nballs, and the great wise tortoises that crawled slowly about, shaking\\ntheir heads and nibbling at the young leaves.  Yes, she must certainly\\ncome to the forest and play with him.  He would give her his own little\\nbed, and would watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the wild\\nhorned cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the\\nhut.  And at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her, and they\\nwould go out and dance together all the day long.  It was really not a\\nbit lonely in the forest.  Sometimes a Bishop rode through on his white\\nmule, reading out of a painted book.  Sometimes in their green velvet\\ncaps, and their jerkins of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with\\nhooded hawks on their wrists.  At vintage-time came the grape-treaders,\\nwith purple hands and feet, wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying\\ndripping skins of wine; and the charcoal-burners sat round their huge\\nbraziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire, and\\nroasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came out of their caves\\nand made merry with them.  Once, too, he had seen a beautiful procession\\nwinding up the long dusty road to Toledo.  The monks went in front\\nsinging sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and\\nthen, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and\\nin their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses\\npainted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in\\ntheir hands.  Certainly there was a great deal to look at in the forest,\\nand when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss for her, or\\ncarry her in his arms, for he was very strong, though he knew that he was\\nnot tall.  He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries, that would\\nbe quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress, and\\nwhen she was tired of them, she could throw them away, and he would find\\nher others.  He would bring her acorn-cups and dew-drenched anemones, and\\ntiny glow-worms to be stars in the pale gold of her hair.\\n\\nBut where was she?  He asked the white rose, and it made him no answer.\\nThe whole palace seemed asleep, and even where the shutters had not been\\nclosed, heavy curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out the\\nglare.  He wandered all round looking for some place through which he\\nmight gain an entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private\\ndoor that was lying open.  He slipped through, and found himself in a\\nsplendid hall, far more splendid, he feared, than the forest, there was\\nso much more gilding everywhere, and even the floor was made of great\\ncoloured stones, fitted together into a sort of geometrical pattern.  But\\nthe little Infanta was not there, only some wonderful white statues that\\nlooked down on him from their jasper pedestals, with sad blank eyes and\\nstrangely smiling lips.\\n\\nAt the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet,\\npowdered with suns and stars, the King’s favourite devices, and broidered\\non the colour he loved best.  Perhaps she was hiding behind that?  He\\nwould try at any rate.\\n\\nSo he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.  No; there was only\\nanother room, though a prettier room, he thought, than the one he had\\njust left.  The walls were hung with a many-figured green arras of\\nneedle-wrought tapestry representing a hunt, the work of some Flemish\\nartists who had spent more than seven years in its composition.  It had\\nonce been the chamber of _Jean le Fou_, as he was called, that mad King\\nwho was so enamoured of the chase, that he had often tried in his\\ndelirium to mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag down the stag on\\nwhich the great hounds were leaping, sounding his hunting horn, and\\nstabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer.  It was now used as the\\ncouncil-room, and on the centre table were lying the red portfolios of\\nthe ministers, stamped with the gold tulips of Spain, and with the arms\\nand emblems of the house of Hapsburg.\\n\\nThe little Dwarf looked in wonder all round him, and was half-afraid to\\ngo on.  The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the\\nlong glades without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible\\nphantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal-burners speaking—the\\nComprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into\\na hind, and chase him.  But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took\\ncourage.  He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved\\nher.  Perhaps she was in the room beyond.\\n\\nHe ran across the soft Moorish carpets, and opened the door.  No!  She\\nwas not here either.  The room was quite empty.\\n\\nIt was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when\\nthe King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a\\npersonal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had\\nappeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their\\nQueen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor’s\\neldest son.  The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt\\nchandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the\\nblack and white ceiling.  Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on\\nwhich the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls,\\nstood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded\\nwith silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.  On\\nthe second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the\\nInfanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that\\nagain, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal\\nNuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King’s presence on\\nthe occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal’s hat, with its\\ntangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple _tabouret_ in front.  On the\\nwall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in\\nhunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip\\nII. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the\\nother wall.  Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with\\nplates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein’s Dance of Death had\\nbeen graved—by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.  He would\\nnot have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white\\npetal of his rose for the throne itself.  What he wanted was to see the\\nInfanta before she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away\\nwith him when he had finished his dance.  Here, in the Palace, the air\\nwas close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the\\nsunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.\\nThere were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the\\nflowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths\\nin early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and\\ngrassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the\\ngnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and\\nirises lilac and gold.  There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the\\nfoxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells.\\nThe chestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid\\nmoons of beauty.  Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her!\\nShe would come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would\\ndance for her delight.  A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he\\npassed into the next room.\\n\\nOf all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful.  The\\nwalls were covered with a pink-flowered Lucca damask, patterned with\\nbirds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of\\nmassive silver, festooned with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in\\nfront of the two large fire-places stood great screens broidered with\\nparrots and peacocks, and the floor, which was of sea-green onyx, seemed\\nto stretch far away into the distance.  Nor was he alone.  Standing under\\nthe shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a\\nlittle figure watching him.  His heart trembled, a cry of joy broke from\\nhis lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.  As he did so, the figure\\nmoved out also, and he saw it plainly.\\n\\nThe Infanta!  It was a monster, the most grotesque monster he had ever\\nbeheld.  Not properly shaped, as all other people were, but hunchbacked,\\nand crooked-limbed, with huge lolling head and mane of black hair.  The\\nlittle Dwarf frowned, and the monster frowned also.  He laughed, and it\\nlaughed with him, and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was\\ndoing.  He made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low reverence.\\nHe went towards it, and it came to meet him, copying each step that he\\nmade, and stopping when he stopped himself.  He shouted with amusement,\\nand ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster\\ntouched his, and it was as cold as ice.  He grew afraid, and moved his\\nhand across, and the monster’s hand followed it quickly.  He tried to\\npress on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.  The face of the\\nmonster was now close to his own, and seemed full of terror.  He brushed\\nhis hair off his eyes.  It imitated him.  He struck at it, and it\\nreturned blow for blow.  He loathed it, and it made hideous faces at him.\\nHe drew back, and it retreated.\\n\\nWhat is it?  He thought for a moment, and looked round at the rest of the\\nroom.  It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this\\ninvisible wall of clear water.  Yes, picture for picture was repeated,\\nand couch for couch.  The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove by the\\ndoorway had its twin brother that slumbered, and the silver Venus that\\nstood in the sunlight held out her arms to a Venus as lovely as herself.\\n\\nWas it Echo?  He had called to her once in the valley, and she had\\nanswered him word for word.  Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the\\nvoice?  Could she make a mimic world just like the real world?  Could the\\nshadows of things have colour and life and movement?  Could it be that—?\\n\\nHe started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose, he\\nturned round, and kissed it.  The monster had a rose of its own, petal\\nfor petal the same!  It kissed it with like kisses, and pressed it to its\\nheart with horrible gestures.\\n\\nWhen the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry of despair, and fell\\nsobbing to the ground.  So it was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked,\\nfoul to look at and grotesque.  He himself was the monster, and it was at\\nhim that all the children had been laughing, and the little Princess who\\nhe had thought loved him—she too had been merely mocking at his ugliness,\\nand making merry over his twisted limbs.  Why had they not left him in\\nthe forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was?\\nWhy had his father not killed him, rather than sell him to his shame?\\nThe hot tears poured down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to\\npieces.  The sprawling monster did the same, and scattered the faint\\npetals in the air.  It grovelled on the ground, and, when he looked at\\nit, it watched him with a face drawn with pain.  He crept away, lest he\\nshould see it, and covered his eyes with his hands.  He crawled, like\\nsome wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning.\\n\\nAnd at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her companions\\nthrough the open window, and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on\\nthe ground and beating the floor with his clenched hands, in the most\\nfantastic and exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy\\nlaughter, and stood all round him and watched him.\\n\\n‘His dancing was funny,’ said the Infanta; ‘but his acting is funnier\\nstill.  Indeed he is almost as good as the puppets, only of course not\\nquite so natural.’  And she fluttered her big fan, and applauded.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter and\\nfainter, and suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his side.  And\\nthen he fell back again, and lay quite still.\\n\\n‘That is capital,’ said the Infanta, after a pause; ‘but now you must\\ndance for me.’\\n\\n‘Yes,’ cried all the children, ‘you must get up and dance, for you are as\\nclever as the Barbary apes, and much more ridiculous.’  But the little\\nDwarf made no answer.\\n\\nAnd the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle, who was\\nwalking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some despatches that\\nhad just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office had recently been\\nestablished.  ‘My funny little dwarf is sulking,’ she cried, ‘you must\\nwake him up, and tell him to dance for me.’\\n\\nThey smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don Pedro stooped down,\\nand slapped the Dwarf on the cheek with his embroidered glove.  ‘You must\\ndance,’ he said, ‘_petit monsire_.  You must dance.  The Infanta of Spain\\nand the Indies wishes to be amused.’\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf never moved.\\n\\n‘A whipping master should be sent for,’ said Don Pedro wearily, and he\\nwent back to the terrace.  But the Chamberlain looked grave, and he knelt\\nbeside the little dwarf, and put his hand upon his heart.  And after a\\nfew moments he shrugged his shoulders, and rose up, and having made a low\\nbow to the Infanta, he said—\\n\\n‘_Mi bella Princesa_, your funny little dwarf will never dance again.  It\\nis a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.’\\n\\n‘But why will he not dance again?’ asked the Infanta, laughing.\\n\\n‘Because his heart is broken,’ answered the Chamberlain.\\n\\nAnd the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose-leaf lips curled in pretty\\ndisdain.  ‘For the future let those who come to play with me have no\\nhearts,’ she cried, and she ran out into the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS SOUL\\n\\n\\n                                TO H.S.H.\\n                             ALICE, PRINCESS\\n                                OF MONACO\\n\\nEVERY evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and threw his\\nnets into the water.\\n\\nWhen the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but little at\\nbest, for it was a bitter and black-winged wind, and rough waves rose up\\nto meet it.  But when the wind blew to the shore, the fish came in from\\nthe deep, and swam into the meshes of his nets, and he took them to the\\nmarket-place and sold them.\\n\\nEvery evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so\\nheavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat.  And he laughed, and\\nsaid to himself, ‘Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared\\nsome dull monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror\\nthat the great Queen will desire,’ and putting forth all his strength, he\\ntugged at the coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase\\nof bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms.  He tugged at the thin\\nropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net\\nrose at last to the top of the water.\\n\\nBut no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of horror, but\\nonly a little Mermaid lying fast asleep.\\n\\nHer hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread\\nof fine gold in a cup of glass.  Her body was as white ivory, and her\\ntail was of silver and pearl.  Silver and pearl was her tail, and the\\ngreen weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea-shells were her\\nears, and her lips were like sea-coral.  The cold waves dashed over her\\ncold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids.\\n\\nSo beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he was filled\\nwith wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him, and\\nleaning over the side he clasped her in his arms.  And when he touched\\nher, she gave a cry like a startled sea-gull, and woke, and looked at him\\nin terror with her mauve-amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might\\nescape.  But he held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to\\ndepart.\\n\\nAnd when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to\\nweep, and said, ‘I pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a\\nKing, and my father is aged and alone.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered, ‘I will not let thee go save thou\\nmakest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to\\nme, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea-folk, and so\\nshall my nets be full.’\\n\\n‘Wilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?’ cried the\\nMermaid.\\n\\n‘In very truth I will let thee go,’ said the young Fisherman.\\n\\nSo she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath of the\\nSea-folk.  And he loosened his arms from about her, and she sank down\\ninto the water, trembling with a strange fear.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nEvery evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and called to\\nthe Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to him.  Round and\\nround her swam the dolphins, and the wild gulls wheeled above her head.\\n\\nAnd she sang a marvellous song.  For she sang of the Sea-folk who drive\\ntheir flocks from cave to cave, and carry the little calves on their\\nshoulders; of the Tritons who have long green beards, and hairy breasts,\\nand blow through twisted conchs when the King passes by; of the palace of\\nthe King which is all of amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a\\npavement of bright pearl; and of the gardens of the sea where the great\\nfiligrane fans of coral wave all day long, and the fish dart about like\\nsilver birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks, and the pinks bourgeon\\nin the ribbed yellow sand.  She sang of the big whales that come down\\nfrom the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their fins; of the\\nSirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to stop\\ntheir ears with wax lest they should hear them, and leap into the water\\nand be drowned; of the sunken galleys with their tall masts, and the\\nfrozen sailors clinging to the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and\\nout of the open portholes; of the little barnacles who are great\\ntravellers, and cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round\\nthe world; and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and\\nstretch out their long black arms, and can make night come when they will\\nit.  She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her own that is carved\\nout of an opal and steered with a silken sail; of the happy Mermen who\\nplay upon harps and can charm the great Kraken to sleep; of the little\\nchildren who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon\\ntheir backs; of the Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their\\narms to the mariners; and of the sea-lions with their curved tusks, and\\nthe sea-horses with their floating manes.\\n\\nAnd as she sang, all the tunny-fish came in from the deep to listen to\\nher, and the young Fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them,\\nand others he took with a spear.  And when his boat was well-laden, the\\nMermaid would sink down into the sea, smiling at him.\\n\\nYet would she never come near him that he might touch her.  Oftentimes he\\ncalled to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to\\nseize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see\\nher again that day.  And each day the sound of her voice became sweeter\\nto his ears.  So sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his\\ncunning, and had no care of his craft.  Vermilion-finned and with eyes of\\nbossy gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not.  His\\nspear lay by his side unused, and his baskets of plaited osier were\\nempty.  With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he sat idle in his\\nboat and listened, listening till the sea-mists crept round him, and the\\nwandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver.\\n\\nAnd one evening he called to her, and said: ‘Little Mermaid, little\\nMermaid, I love thee.  Take me for thy bridegroom, for I love thee.’\\n\\nBut the Mermaid shook her head.  ‘Thou hast a human soul,’ she answered.\\n‘If only thou wouldst send away thy soul, then could I love thee.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to himself, ‘Of what use is my soul to me?\\nI cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.  Surely I will\\nsend it away from me, and much gladness shall be mine.’  And a cry of joy\\nbroke from his lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his\\narms to the Mermaid.  ‘I will send my soul away,’ he cried, ‘and you\\nshall be my bride, and I will be thy bridegroom, and in the depth of the\\nsea we will dwell together, and all that thou hast sung of thou shalt\\nshow me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor shall our lives be\\ndivided.’\\n\\nAnd the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in her\\nhands.\\n\\n‘But how shall I send my soul from me?’ cried the young Fisherman.  ‘Tell\\nme how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.’\\n\\n‘Alas!  I know not,’ said the little Mermaid: ‘the Sea-folk have no\\nsouls.’  And she sank down into the deep, looking wistfully at him.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man’s\\nhand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest\\nand knocked three times at the door.\\n\\nThe novice looked out through the wicket, and when he saw who it was, he\\ndrew back the latch and said to him, ‘Enter.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the sweet-smelling\\nrushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was reading out of the\\nHoly Book and said to him, ‘Father, I am in love with one of the\\nSea-folk, and my soul hindereth me from having my desire.  Tell me how I\\ncan send my soul away from me, for in truth I have no need of it.  Of\\nwhat value is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do\\nnot know it.’\\n\\nAnd the Priest beat his breast, and answered, ‘Alack, alack, thou art\\nmad, or hast eaten of some poisonous herb, for the soul is the noblest\\npart of man, and was given to us by God that we should nobly use it.\\nThere is no thing more precious than a human soul, nor any earthly thing\\nthat can be weighed with it.  It is worth all the gold that is in the\\nworld, and is more precious than the rubies of the kings.  Therefore, my\\nson, think not any more of this matter, for it is a sin that may not be\\nforgiven.  And as for the Sea-folk, they are lost, and they who would\\ntraffic with them are lost also.  They are as the beasts of the field\\nthat know not good from evil, and for them the Lord has not died.’\\n\\nThe young Fisherman’s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter\\nwords of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him,\\n‘Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit\\nthe Mermen with their harps of red gold.  Let me be as they are, I\\nbeseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers.  And as for my\\nsoul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing\\nthat I love?’\\n\\n‘The love of the body is vile,’ cried the Priest, knitting his brows,\\n‘and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His\\nworld.  Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the\\nsingers of the sea!  I have heard them at night-time, and they have\\nsought to lure me from my beads.  They tap at the window, and laugh.\\nThey whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.  They tempt me\\nwith temptations, and when I would pray they make mouths at me.  They are\\nlost, I tell thee, they are lost.  For them there is no heaven nor hell,\\nand in neither shall they praise God’s name.’\\n\\n‘Father,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘thou knowest not what thou sayest.\\nOnce in my net I snared the daughter of a King.  She is fairer than the\\nmorning star, and whiter than the moon.  For her body I would give my\\nsoul, and for her love I would surrender heaven.  Tell me what I ask of\\nthee, and let me go in peace.’\\n\\n‘Away!  Away!’ cried the Priest: ‘thy leman is lost, and thou shalt be\\nlost with her.’\\n\\nAnd he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he walked\\nslowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.\\n\\nAnd when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each\\nother, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him by name,\\nand said to him, ‘What hast thou to sell?’\\n\\n‘I will sell thee my soul,’ he answered.  ‘I pray thee buy it of me, for\\nI am weary of it.  Of what use is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may\\nnot touch it.  I do not know it.’\\n\\nBut the merchants mocked at him, and said, ‘Of what use is a man’s soul\\nto us?  It is not worth a clipped piece of silver.  Sell us thy body for\\na slave, and we will clothe thee in sea-purple, and put a ring upon thy\\nfinger, and make thee the minion of the great Queen.  But talk not of the\\nsoul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to himself: ‘How strange a thing this is!\\nThe Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world,\\nand the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.’\\nAnd he passed out of the market-place, and went down to the shore of the\\nsea, and began to ponder on what he should do.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a gatherer\\nof samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave at\\nthe head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries.  And he set\\nto and ran, so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust\\nfollowed him as he sped round the sand of the shore.  By the itching of\\nher palm the young Witch knew his coming, and she laughed and let down\\nher red hair.  With her red hair falling around her, she stood at the\\nopening of the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that\\nwas blossoming.\\n\\n‘What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?’ she cried, as he came panting up the\\nsteep, and bent down before her.  ‘Fish for thy net, when the wind is\\nfoul?  I have a little reed-pipe, and when I blow on it the mullet come\\nsailing into the bay.  But it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.\\nWhat d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?  A storm to wreck the ships, and wash\\nthe chests of rich treasure ashore?  I have more storms than the wind\\nhas, for I serve one who is stronger than the wind, and with a sieve and\\na pail of water I can send the great galleys to the bottom of the sea.\\nBut I have a price, pretty boy, I have a price.  What d’ye lack?  What\\nd’ye lack?  I know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows it but\\nI.  It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as\\nwhite as milk.  Shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the\\nQueen, she would follow thee all over the world.  Out of the bed of the\\nKing she would rise, and over the whole world she would follow thee.  And\\nit has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.  What d’ye lack?  What d’ye\\nlack?  I can pound a toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the\\nbroth with a dead man’s hand.  Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he\\nsleeps, and he will turn into a black viper, and his own mother will slay\\nhim.  With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven, and in a crystal I\\ncan show thee Death.  What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?  Tell me thy\\ndesire, and I will give it thee, and thou shalt pay me a price, pretty\\nboy, thou shalt pay me a price.’\\n\\n‘My desire is but for a little thing,’ said the young Fisherman, ‘yet\\nhath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth.  It is but for a\\nlittle thing, and the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me.\\nTherefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever be\\nthy price I shall pay it.’\\n\\n‘What wouldst thou?’ asked the Witch, coming near to him.\\n\\n‘I would send my soul away from me,’ answered the young Fisherman.\\n\\nThe Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle.\\n‘Pretty boy, pretty boy,’ she muttered, ‘that is a terrible thing to do.’\\n\\nHe tossed his brown curls and laughed.  ‘My soul is nought to me,’ he\\nanswered.  ‘I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.’\\n\\n‘What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?’ asked the Witch, looking down at\\nhim with her beautiful eyes.\\n\\n‘Five pieces of gold,’ he said, ‘and my nets, and the wattled house where\\nI live, and the painted boat in which I sail.  Only tell me how to get\\nrid of my soul, and I will give thee all that I possess.’\\n\\nShe laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock.\\n‘I can turn the autumn leaves into gold,’ she answered, ‘and I can weave\\nthe pale moonbeams into silver if I will it.  He whom I serve is richer\\nthan all the kings of this world, and has their dominions.’\\n\\n‘What then shall I give thee,’ he cried, ‘if thy price be neither gold\\nnor silver?’\\n\\nThe Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand.  ‘Thou must dance\\nwith me, pretty boy,’ she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke.\\n\\n‘Nought but that?’ cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he rose to his\\nfeet.\\n\\n‘Nought but that,’ she answered, and she smiled at him again.\\n\\n‘Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,’ he said,\\n‘and after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I\\ndesire to know.’\\n\\nShe shook her head.  ‘When the moon is full, when the moon is full,’ she\\nmuttered.  Then she peered all round, and listened.  A blue bird rose\\nscreaming from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted\\nbirds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other.\\nThere was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth\\npebbles below.  So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and\\nput her dry lips close to his ear.\\n\\n‘To-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,’ she whispered.  ‘It\\nis a Sabbath, and He will be there.’\\n\\nThe young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white\\nteeth and laughed.  ‘Who is He of whom thou speakest?’ he asked.\\n\\n‘It matters not,’ she answered.  ‘Go thou to-night, and stand under the\\nbranches of the hornbeam, and wait for my coming.  If a black dog run\\ntowards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and it will go away.  If an\\nowl speak to thee, make it no answer.  When the moon is full I shall be\\nwith thee, and we will dance together on the grass.’\\n\\n‘But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?’ he\\nmade question.\\n\\nShe moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the\\nwind.  ‘By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,’ she made answer.\\n\\n‘Thou art the best of the witches,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘and I\\nwill surely dance with thee to-night on the top of the mountain.  I would\\nindeed that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver.  But such as\\nthy price is thou shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.’  And he\\ndoffed his cap to her, and bent his head low, and ran back to the town\\nfilled with a great joy.\\n\\nAnd the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her\\nsight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of\\ncarved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned vervain on lighted\\ncharcoal before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke.  And after\\na time she clenched her hands in anger.  ‘He should have been mine,’ she\\nmuttered, ‘I am as fair as she is.’\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up\\nto the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.\\nLike a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the\\nshadows of the fishing-boats moved in the little bay.  A great owl, with\\nyellow sulphurous eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no\\nanswer.  A black dog ran towards him and snarled.  He struck it with a\\nrod of willow, and it went away whining.\\n\\nAt midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats.  ‘Phew!’\\nthey cried, as they lit upon the ground, ‘there is some one here we know\\nnot!’ and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made\\nsigns.  Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in\\nthe wind.  She wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks’\\neyes, and a little cap of green velvet was on her head.\\n\\n‘Where is he, where is he?’ shrieked the witches when they saw her, but\\nshe only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by\\nthe hand she led him out into the moonlight and began to dance.\\n\\nRound and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high that he\\ncould see the scarlet heels of her shoes.  Then right across the dancers\\ncame the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen,\\nand he felt afraid.\\n\\n‘Faster,’ cried the Witch, and she threw her arms about his neck, and her\\nbreath was hot upon his face.  ‘Faster, faster!’ she cried, and the earth\\nseemed to spin beneath his feet, and his brain grew troubled, and a great\\nterror fell on him, as of some evil thing that was watching him, and at\\nlast he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure\\nthat had not been there before.\\n\\nIt was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the Spanish\\nfashion.  His face was strangely pale, but his lips were like a proud red\\nflower.  He seemed weary, and was leaning back toying in a listless\\nmanner with the pommel of his dagger.  On the grass beside him lay a\\nplumed hat, and a pair of riding-gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and\\nsewn with seed-pearls wrought into a curious device.  A short cloak lined\\nwith sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate white hands were\\ngemmed with rings.  Heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes.\\n\\nThe young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell.  At last their\\neyes met, and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the\\nman were upon him.  He heard the Witch laugh, and caught her by the\\nwaist, and whirled her madly round and round.\\n\\nSuddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and going up\\ntwo by two, knelt down, and kissed the man’s hands.  As they did so, a\\nlittle smile touched his proud lips, as a bird’s wing touches the water\\nand makes it laugh.  But there was disdain in it.  He kept looking at the\\nyoung Fisherman.\\n\\n‘Come! let us worship,’ whispered the Witch, and she led him up, and a\\ngreat desire to do as she besought him seized on him, and he followed\\nher.  But when he came close, and without knowing why he did it, he made\\non his breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name.\\n\\nNo sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew\\naway, and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a\\nspasm of pain.  The man went over to a little wood, and whistled.  A\\njennet with silver trappings came running to meet him.  As he leapt upon\\nthe saddle he turned round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly.\\n\\nAnd the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the Fisherman\\ncaught her by her wrists, and held her fast.\\n\\n‘Loose me,’ she cried, ‘and let me go.  For thou hast named what should\\nnot be named, and shown the sign that may not be looked at.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ he answered, ‘but I will not let thee go till thou hast told me\\nthe secret.’\\n\\n‘What secret?’ said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild cat, and\\nbiting her foam-flecked lips.\\n\\n‘Thou knowest,’ he made answer.\\n\\nHer grass-green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the Fisherman,\\n‘Ask me anything but that!’\\n\\nHe laughed, and held her all the more tightly.\\n\\nAnd when she saw that she could not free herself, she whispered to him,\\n‘Surely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those\\nthat dwell in the blue waters,’ and she fawned on him and put her face\\nclose to his.\\n\\nBut he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, ‘If thou keepest not\\nthe promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.’\\n\\nShe grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered.  ‘Be it so,’\\nshe muttered.  ‘It is thy soul and not mine.  Do with it as thou wilt.’\\nAnd she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green\\nviper’s skin, and gave it to him.\\n\\n‘What shall this serve me?’ he asked of her, wondering.\\n\\nShe was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over her\\nface.  Then she brushed her hair back from her forehead, and smiling\\nstrangely she said to him, ‘What men call the shadow of the body is not\\nthe shadow of the body, but is the body of the soul.  Stand on the\\nsea-shore with thy back to the moon, and cut away from around thy feet\\nthy shadow, which is thy soul’s body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it\\nwill do so.’\\n\\nThe young Fisherman trembled.  ‘Is this true?’ he murmured.\\n\\n‘It is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,’ she cried, and\\nshe clung to his knees weeping.\\n\\nHe put her from him and left her in the rank grass, and going to the edge\\nof the mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began to climb down.\\n\\nAnd his Soul that was within him called out to him and said, ‘Lo!  I have\\ndwelt with thee for all these years, and have been thy servant.  Send me\\nnot away from thee now, for what evil have I done thee?’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman laughed.  ‘Thou hast done me no evil, but I have\\nno need of thee,’ he answered.  ‘The world is wide, and there is Heaven\\nalso, and Hell, and that dim twilight house that lies between.  Go\\nwherever thou wilt, but trouble me not, for my love is calling to me.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul besought him piteously, but he heeded it not, but leapt from\\ncrag to crag, being sure-footed as a wild goat, and at last he reached\\nthe level ground and the yellow shore of the sea.\\n\\nBronze-limbed and well-knit, like a statue wrought by a Grecian, he stood\\non the sand with his back to the moon, and out of the foam came white\\narms that beckoned to him, and out of the waves rose dim forms that did\\nhim homage.  Before him lay his shadow, which was the body of his soul,\\nand behind him hung the moon in the honey-coloured air.\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to him, ‘If indeed thou must drive me from thee, send\\nme not forth without a heart.  The world is cruel, give me thy heart to\\ntake with me.’\\n\\nHe tossed his head and smiled.  ‘With what should I love my love if I\\ngave thee my heart?’ he cried.\\n\\n‘Nay, but be merciful,’ said his Soul: ‘give me thy heart, for the world\\nis very cruel, and I am afraid.’\\n\\n‘My heart is my love’s,’ he answered, ‘therefore tarry not, but get thee\\ngone.’\\n\\n‘Should I not love also?’ asked his Soul.\\n\\n‘Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,’ cried the young Fisherman,\\nand he took the little knife with its handle of green viper’s skin, and\\ncut away his shadow from around his feet, and it rose up and stood before\\nhim, and looked at him, and it was even as himself.\\n\\nHe crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling of awe\\ncame over him.  ‘Get thee gone,’ he murmured, ‘and let me see thy face no\\nmore.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but we must meet again,’ said the Soul.  Its voice was low and\\nflute-like, and its lips hardly moved while it spake.\\n\\n‘How shall we meet?’ cried the young Fisherman.  ‘Thou wilt not follow me\\ninto the depths of the sea?’\\n\\n‘Once every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,’ said the\\nSoul.  ‘It may be that thou wilt have need of me.’\\n\\n‘What need should I have of thee?’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘but be it\\nas thou wilt,’ and he plunged into the waters and the Tritons blew their\\nhorns and the little Mermaid rose up to meet him, and put her arms around\\nhis neck and kissed him on the mouth.\\n\\nAnd the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.  And when they\\nhad sunk down into the sea, it went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and\\ncalled to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said,\\n‘Why dost thou call to me?’\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.’\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‘When I left thee I turned my face to the East\\nand journeyed.  From the East cometh everything that is wise.  Six days I\\njourneyed, and on the morning of the seventh day I came to a hill that is\\nin the country of the Tartars.  I sat down under the shade of a tamarisk\\ntree to shelter myself from the sun.  The land was dry and burnt up with\\nthe heat.  The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling\\nupon a disk of polished copper.\\n\\n‘When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the\\nland.  When the Tartars saw it, they strung their painted bows, and\\nhaving leapt upon their little horses they galloped to meet it.  The\\nwomen fled screaming to the waggons, and hid themselves behind the felt\\ncurtains.\\n\\n‘At twilight the Tartars returned, but five of them were missing, and of\\nthose that came back not a few had been wounded.  They harnessed their\\nhorses to the waggons and drove hastily away.  Three jackals came out of\\na cave and peered after them.  Then they sniffed up the air with their\\nnostrils, and trotted off in the opposite direction.\\n\\n‘When the moon rose I saw a camp-fire burning on the plain, and went\\ntowards it.  A company of merchants were seated round it on carpets.\\nTheir camels were picketed behind them, and the negroes who were their\\nservants were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand, and making a\\nhigh wall of the prickly pear.\\n\\n‘As I came near them, the chief of the merchants rose up and drew his\\nsword, and asked me my business.\\n\\n‘I answered that I was a Prince in my own land, and that I had escaped\\nfrom the Tartars, who had sought to make me their slave.  The chief\\nsmiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo.\\n\\n‘Then he asked me who was the prophet of God, and I answered him\\nMohammed.\\n\\n‘When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the\\nhand, and placed me by his side.  A negro brought me some mare’s milk in\\na wooden dish, and a piece of lamb’s flesh roasted.\\n\\n‘At daybreak we started on our journey.  I rode on a red-haired camel by\\nthe side of the chief, and a runner ran before us carrying a spear.  The\\nmen of war were on either hand, and the mules followed with the\\nmerchandise.  There were forty camels in the caravan, and the mules were\\ntwice forty in number.\\n\\n‘We went from the country of the Tartars into the country of those who\\ncurse the Moon.  We saw the Gryphons guarding their gold on the white\\nrocks, and the scaled Dragons sleeping in their caves.  As we passed over\\nthe mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and\\neach man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes.  As we passed through the\\nvalleys the Pygmies shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and\\nat night-time we heard the wild men beating on their drums.  When we came\\nto the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm us.\\nWhen we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm milk in howls of\\nbrass, and they let us go by.  Three times in our journey we came to the\\nbanks of the Oxus.  We crossed it on rafts of wood with great bladders of\\nblown hide.  The river-horses raged against us and sought to slay us.\\nWhen the camels saw them they trembled.\\n\\n‘The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to\\nenter their gates.  They threw us bread over the walls, little\\nmaize-cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates.\\nFor every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber.\\n\\n‘When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells\\nand fled to the hill-summits.  We fought with the Magadae who are born\\nold, and grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are\\nlittle children; and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of\\ntigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who\\nbury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns\\nlest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians\\nwho worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it\\nwith butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced;\\nand with the Sibans, who have horses’ feet, and run more swiftly than\\nhorses.  A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want.\\nThe rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil\\nfortune.  I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me.\\nWhen they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.\\n\\n‘In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel.  It was night-time\\nwhen we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was\\nsultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion.  We took the ripe\\npomegranates from the trees, and brake them, and drank their sweet\\njuices.  Then we lay down on our carpets, and waited for the dawn.\\n\\n‘And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city.  It was wrought\\nout of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and dragons that have\\nwings.  The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our\\nbusiness.  The interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from\\nthe island of Syria with much merchandise.  They took hostages, and told\\nus that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till\\nthen.\\n\\n‘When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people\\ncame crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the\\ncity crying through a shell.  We stood in the market-place, and the\\nnegroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests\\nof sycamore.  And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth\\ntheir strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen\\nfrom the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the\\nblue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of\\nglass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.  From the roof of a house a\\ncompany of women watched us.  One of them wore a mask of gilded leather.\\n\\n‘And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the\\nsecond day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and\\nthe slaves.  And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they\\ntarry in the city.\\n\\n‘And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and\\nwandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of\\nits god.  The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the\\ngreen trees, and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose-red house\\nin which the god had his dwelling.  Its doors were of powdered lacquer,\\nand bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold.\\nThe tilted roof was of sea-green porcelain, and the jutting eaves were\\nfestooned with little bells.  When the white doves flew past, they struck\\nthe bells with their wings and made them tinkle.\\n\\n‘In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx.\\nI lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad\\nleaves.  One of the priests came towards me and stood behind me.  He had\\nsandals on his feet, one of soft serpent-skin and the other of birds’\\nplumage.  On his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver\\ncrescents.  Seven yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair\\nwas stained with antimony.\\n\\n‘After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire.\\n\\n‘I told him that my desire was to see the god.\\n\\n‘“The god is hunting,” said the priest, looking strangely at me with his\\nsmall slanting eyes.\\n\\n‘“Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him,” I answered.\\n\\n‘He combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails.\\n“The god is asleep,” he murmured.\\n\\n‘“Tell me on what couch, and I will watch by him,” I answered.\\n\\n‘“The god is at the feast,” he cried.\\n\\n‘“If the wine be sweet I will drink it with him, and if it be bitter I\\nwill drink it with him also,” was my answer.\\n\\n‘He bowed his head in wonder, and, taking me by the hand, he raised me\\nup, and led me into the temple.\\n\\n‘And in the first chamber I saw an idol seated on a throne of jasper\\nbordered with great orient pearls.  It was carved out of ebony, and in\\nstature was of the stature of a man.  On its forehead was a ruby, and\\nthick oil dripped from its hair on to its thighs.  Its feet were red with\\nthe blood of a newly-slain kid, and its loins girt with a copper belt\\nthat was studded with seven beryls.\\n\\n‘And I said to the priest, “Is this the god?”  And he answered me, “This\\nis the god.”\\n\\n‘“Show me the god,” I cried, “or I will surely slay thee.”  And I touched\\nhis hand, and it became withered.\\n\\n‘And the priest besought me, saying, “Let my lord heal his servant, and I\\nwill show him the god.”\\n\\n‘So I breathed with my breath upon his hand, and it became whole again,\\nand he trembled and led me into the second chamber, and I saw an idol\\nstanding on a lotus of jade hung with great emeralds.  It was carved out\\nof ivory, and in stature was twice the stature of a man.  On its forehead\\nwas a chrysolite, and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon.\\nIn one hand it held a crooked sceptre of jade, and in the other a round\\ncrystal.  It ware buskins of brass, and its thick neck was circled with a\\ncircle of selenites.\\n\\n‘And I said to the priest, “Is this the god?”\\n\\n‘And he answered me, “This is the god.”\\n\\n‘“Show me the god,” I cried, “or I will surely slay thee.”  And I touched\\nhis eyes, and they became blind.\\n\\n‘And the priest besought me, saying, “Let my lord heal his servant, and I\\nwill show him the god.”\\n\\n‘So I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came back to\\nthem, and he trembled again, and led me into the third chamber, and lo!\\nthere was no idol in it, nor image of any kind, but only a mirror of\\nround metal set on an altar of stone.\\n\\n‘And I said to the priest, “Where is the god?”\\n\\n‘And he answered me: “There is no god but this mirror that thou seest,\\nfor this is the Mirror of Wisdom.  And it reflecteth all things that are\\nin heaven and on earth, save only the face of him who looketh into it.\\nThis it reflecteth not, so that he who looketh into it may be wise.  Many\\nother mirrors are there, but they are mirrors of Opinion.  This only is\\nthe Mirror of Wisdom.  And they who possess this mirror know everything,\\nnor is there anything hidden from them.  And they who possess it not have\\nnot Wisdom.  Therefore is it the god, and we worship it.”  And I looked\\ninto the mirror, and it was even as he had said to me.\\n\\n‘And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a valley\\nthat is but a day’s journey from this place have I hidden the Mirror of\\nWisdom.  Do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant,\\nand thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine.\\nSuffer me to enter into thee, and none will be as wise as thou.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman laughed.  ‘Love is better than Wisdom,’ he cried,\\n‘and the little Mermaid loves me.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,’ said the Soul.\\n\\n‘Love is better,’ answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the\\ndeep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after the second year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of\\nthe sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep\\nand said, ‘Why dost thou call to me?’\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.’\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‘When I left thee, I turned my face to the\\nSouth and journeyed.  From the South cometh everything that is precious.\\nSix days I journeyed along the highways that lead to the city of Ashter,\\nalong the dusty red-dyed highways by which the pilgrims are wont to go\\ndid I journey, and on the morning of the seventh day I lifted up my eyes,\\nand lo! the city lay at my feet, for it is in a valley.\\n\\n‘There are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate stands a\\nbronze horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from the mountains.\\nThe walls are cased with copper, and the watch-towers on the walls are\\nroofed with brass.  In every tower stands an archer with a bow in his\\nhand.  At sunrise he strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he\\nblows through a horn of horn.\\n\\n‘When I sought to enter, the guards stopped me and asked of me who I was.\\nI made answer that I was a Dervish and on my way to the city of Mecca,\\nwhere there was a green veil on which the Koran was embroidered in silver\\nletters by the hands of the angels.  They were filled with wonder, and\\nentreated me to pass in.\\n\\n‘Inside it is even as a bazaar.  Surely thou shouldst have been with me.\\nAcross the narrow streets the gay lanterns of paper flutter like large\\nbutterflies.  When the wind blows over the roofs they rise and fall as\\npainted bubbles do.  In front of their booths sit the merchants on silken\\ncarpets.  They have straight black beards, and their turbans are covered\\nwith golden sequins, and long strings of amber and carved peach-stones\\nglide through their cool fingers.  Some of them sell galbanum and nard,\\nand curious perfumes from the islands of the Indian Sea, and the thick\\noil of red roses, and myrrh and little nail-shaped cloves.  When one\\nstops to speak to them, they throw pinches of frankincense upon a\\ncharcoal brazier and make the air sweet.  I saw a Syrian who held in his\\nhands a thin rod like a reed.  Grey threads of smoke came from it, and\\nits odour as it burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring.\\nOthers sell silver bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise\\nstones, and anklets of brass wire fringed with little pearls, and tigers’\\nclaws set in gold, and the claws of that gilt cat, the leopard, set in\\ngold also, and earrings of pierced emerald, and finger-rings of hollowed\\njade.  From the tea-houses comes the sound of the guitar, and the\\nopium-smokers with their white smiling faces look out at the passers-by.\\n\\n‘Of a truth thou shouldst have been with me.  The wine-sellers elbow\\ntheir way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders.\\nMost of them sell the wine of Schiraz, which is as sweet as honey.  They\\nserve it in little metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it.  In the\\nmarket-place stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe\\nfigs, with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and\\nyellow as topazes, citrons and rose-apples and clusters of white grapes,\\nround red-gold oranges, and oval lemons of green gold.  Once I saw an\\nelephant go by.  Its trunk was painted with vermilion and turmeric, and\\nover its ears it had a net of crimson silk cord.  It stopped opposite one\\nof the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed.\\nThou canst not think how strange a people they are.  When they are glad\\nthey go to the bird-sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free\\nthat their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge\\nthemselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less.\\n\\n‘One evening I met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin through the\\nbazaar.  It was made of gilded bamboo, and the poles were of vermilion\\nlacquer studded with brass peacocks.  Across the windows hung thin\\ncurtains of muslin embroidered with beetles’ wings and with tiny\\nseed-pearls, and as it passed by a pale-faced Circassian looked out and\\nsmiled at me.  I followed behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and\\nscowled.  But I did not care.  I felt a great curiosity come over me.\\n\\n‘At last they stopped at a square white house.  There were no windows to\\nit, only a little door like the door of a tomb.  They set down the\\npalanquin and knocked three times with a copper hammer.  An Armenian in a\\ncaftan of green leather peered through the wicket, and when he saw them\\nhe opened, and spread a carpet on the ground, and the woman stepped out.\\nAs she went in, she turned round and smiled at me again.  I had never\\nseen any one so pale.\\n\\n‘When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the\\nhouse, but it was no longer there.  When I saw that, I knew who the woman\\nwas, and wherefore she had smiled at me.\\n\\n‘Certainly thou shouldst have been with me.  On the feast of the New Moon\\nthe young Emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to\\npray.  His hair and beard were dyed with rose-leaves, and his cheeks were\\npowdered with a fine gold dust.  The palms of his feet and hands were\\nyellow with saffron.\\n\\n‘At sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver, and at\\nsunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold.  The people flung\\nthemselves on the ground and hid their faces, but I would not do so.  I\\nstood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited.  When the Emperor saw\\nme, he raised his painted eyebrows and stopped.  I stood quite still, and\\nmade him no obeisance.  The people marvelled at my boldness, and\\ncounselled me to flee from the city.  I paid no heed to them, but went\\nand sat with the sellers of strange gods, who by reason of their craft\\nare abominated.  When I told them what I had done, each of them gave me a\\ngod and prayed me to leave them.\\n\\n‘That night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea-house that is in the Street\\nof Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and led me to the\\npalace.  As I went in they closed each door behind me, and put a chain\\nacross it.  Inside was a great court with an arcade running all round.\\nThe walls were of white alabaster, set here and there with blue and green\\ntiles.  The pillars were of green marble, and the pavement of a kind of\\npeach-blossom marble.  I had never seen anything like it before.\\n\\n‘As I passed across the court two veiled women looked down from a balcony\\nand cursed me.  The guards hastened on, and the butts of the lances rang\\nupon the polished floor.  They opened a gate of wrought ivory, and I\\nfound myself in a watered garden of seven terraces.  It was planted with\\ntulip-cups and moonflowers, and silver-studded aloes.  Like a slim reed\\nof crystal a fountain hung in the dusky air.  The cypress-trees were like\\nburnt-out torches.  From one of them a nightingale was singing.\\n\\n‘At the end of the garden stood a little pavilion.  As we approached it\\ntwo eunuchs came out to meet us.  Their fat bodies swayed as they walked,\\nand they glanced curiously at me with their yellow-lidded eyes.  One of\\nthem drew aside the captain of the guard, and in a low voice whispered to\\nhim.  The other kept munching scented pastilles, which he took with an\\naffected gesture out of an oval box of lilac enamel.\\n\\n‘After a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers.\\nThey went back to the palace, the eunuchs following slowly behind and\\nplucking the sweet mulberries from the trees as they passed.  Once the\\nelder of the two turned round, and smiled at me with an evil smile.\\n\\n‘Then the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance of the\\npavilion.  I walked on without trembling, and drawing the heavy curtain\\naside I entered in.\\n\\n‘The young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins, and a\\ngerfalcon perched upon his wrist.  Behind him stood a brass-turbaned\\nNubian, naked down to the waist, and with heavy earrings in his split\\nears.  On a table by the side of the couch lay a mighty scimitar of\\nsteel.\\n\\n‘When the Emperor saw me he frowned, and said to me, “What is thy name?\\nKnowest thou not that I am Emperor of this city?”  But I made him no\\nanswer.\\n\\n‘He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it,\\nand rushing forward struck at me with great violence.  The blade whizzed\\nthrough me, and did me no hurt.  The man fell sprawling on the floor, and\\nwhen he rose up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind\\nthe couch.\\n\\n‘The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms,\\nhe threw it at me.  I caught it in its flight, and brake the shaft into\\ntwo pieces.  He shot at me with an arrow, but I held up my hands and it\\nstopped in mid-air.  Then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather,\\nand stabbed the Nubian in the throat lest the slave should tell of his\\ndishonour.  The man writhed like a trampled snake, and a red foam bubbled\\nfrom his lips.\\n\\n‘As soon as he was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped\\naway the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and\\npurple silk, he said to me, “Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm\\nthee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt?  I pray thee\\nleave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its\\nlord.”\\n\\n‘And I answered him, “I will go for half of thy treasure.  Give me half\\nof thy treasure, and I will go away.”\\n\\n‘He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden.  When the\\ncaptain of the guard saw me, he wondered.  When the eunuchs saw me, their\\nknees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear.\\n\\n‘There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry,\\nand a brass-sealed ceiling hung with lamps.  The Emperor touched one of\\nthe walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with\\nmany torches.  In niches upon each side stood great wine-jars filled to\\nthe brim with silver pieces.  When we reached the centre of the corridor\\nthe Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door\\nswung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face lest\\nhis eyes should be dazzled.\\n\\n‘Thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was.  There were huge\\ntortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size\\npiled up with red rubies.  The gold was stored in coffers of\\nelephant-hide, and the gold-dust in leather bottles.  There were opals\\nand sapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of\\njade.  Round green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of\\nivory, and in one corner were silk bags filled, some with\\nturquoise-stones, and others with beryls.  The ivory horns were heaped\\nwith purple amethysts, and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and\\nsards.  The pillars, which were of cedar, were hung with strings of\\nyellow lynx-stones.  In the flat oval shields there were carbuncles, both\\nwine-coloured and coloured like grass.  And yet I have told thee but a\\ntithe of what was there.\\n\\n‘And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he\\nsaid to me: “This is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is\\nthine, even as I promised to thee.  And I will give thee camels and camel\\ndrivers, and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure\\nto whatever part of the world thou desirest to go.  And the thing shall\\nbe done to-night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should\\nsee that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.”\\n\\n‘But I answered him, “The gold that is here is thine, and the silver also\\nis thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price.  As\\nfor me, I have no need of these.  Nor shall I take aught from thee but\\nthat little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.”\\n\\n‘And the Emperor frowned.  “It is but a ring of lead,” he cried, “nor has\\nit any value.  Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my\\ncity.”\\n\\n‘“Nay,” I answered, “but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I\\nknow what is written within it, and for what purpose.”\\n\\n‘And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, “Take all the\\ntreasure and go from my city.  The half that is mine shall be thine\\nalso.”\\n\\n‘And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave\\nthat is but a day’s journey from this place have, I hidden the Ring of\\nRiches.  It is but a day’s journey from this place, and it waits for thy\\ncoming.  He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world.\\nCome therefore and take it, and the world’s riches shall be thine.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman laughed.  ‘Love is better than Riches,’ he cried,\\n‘and the little Mermaid loves me.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but there is nothing better than Riches,’ said the Soul.\\n\\n‘Love is better,’ answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the\\ndeep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after the third year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the\\nsea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and\\nsaid, ‘Why dost thou call to me?’\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.’\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‘In a city that I know of there is an inn that\\nstandeth by a river.  I sat there with sailors who drank of two\\ndifferent-coloured wines, and ate bread made of barley, and little salt\\nfish served in bay leaves with vinegar.  And as we sat and made merry,\\nthere entered to us an old man bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that\\nhad two horns of amber.  And when he had laid out the carpet on the\\nfloor, he struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute, and a girl\\nwhose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us.  Her face was\\nveiled with a veil of gauze, but her feet were naked.  Naked were her\\nfeet, and they moved over the carpet like little white pigeons.  Never\\nhave I seen anything so marvellous; and the city in which she dances is\\nbut a day’s journey from this place.’\\n\\nNow when the young Fisherman heard the words of his Soul, he remembered\\nthat the little Mermaid had no feet and could not dance.  And a great\\ndesire came over him, and he said to himself, ‘It is but a day’s journey,\\nand I can return to my love,’ and he laughed, and stood up in the shallow\\nwater, and strode towards the shore.\\n\\nAnd when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again, and held out his\\narms to his Soul.  And his Soul gave a great cry of joy and ran to meet\\nhim, and entered into him, and the young Fisherman saw stretched before\\nhim upon the sand that shadow of the body that is the body of the Soul.\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to him, ‘Let us not tarry, but get hence at once, for\\nthe Sea-gods are jealous, and have monsters that do their bidding.’\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nSo they made haste, and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon,\\nand all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun, and on the evening\\nof the day they came to a city.\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in which she\\ndances of whom thou didst speak to me?’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘It is not this city, but another.\\nNevertheless let us enter in.’  So they entered in and passed through the\\nstreets, and as they passed through the Street of the Jewellers the young\\nFisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth.  And his Soul said\\nto him, ‘Take that silver cup and hide it.’\\n\\nSo he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they went\\nhurriedly out of the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman\\nfrowned, and flung the cup away, and said to his Soul, ‘Why didst thou\\ntell me to take this cup and hide it, for it was an evil thing to do?’\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’\\n\\nAnd on the evening of the second day they came to a city, and the young\\nFisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in which she dances of whom\\nthou didst speak to me?’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘It is not this city, but another.\\nNevertheless let us enter in.’  So they entered in and passed through the\\nstreets, and as they passed through the Street of the Sellers of Sandals,\\nthe young Fisherman saw a child standing by a jar of water.  And his Soul\\nsaid to him, ‘Smite that child.’  So he smote the child till it wept, and\\nwhen he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone a league from the city the young Fisherman\\ngrew wroth, and said to his Soul, ‘Why didst thou tell me to smite the\\nchild, for it was an evil thing to do?’\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’\\n\\nAnd on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the young\\nFisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in which she dances of whom\\nthou didst speak to me?’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘It may be that it is in this city, therefore\\nlet us enter in.’\\n\\nSo they entered in and passed through the streets, but nowhere could the\\nyoung Fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by its side.  And\\nthe people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and\\nsaid to his Soul, ‘Let us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is\\nnot here.’\\n\\nBut his Soul answered, ‘Nay, but let us tarry, for the night is dark and\\nthere will be robbers on the way.’\\n\\nSo he sat him down in the market-place and rested, and after a time there\\nwent by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a\\nlantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed.  And the merchant\\nsaid to him, ‘Why dost thou sit in the market-place, seeing that the\\nbooths are closed and the bales corded?’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman answered him, ‘I can find no inn in this city,\\nnor have I any kinsman who might give me shelter.’\\n\\n‘Are we not all kinsmen?’ said the merchant.  ‘And did not one God make\\nus?  Therefore come with me, for I have a guest-chamber.’\\n\\nSo the young Fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his house.\\nAnd when he had passed through a garden of pomegranates and entered into\\nthe house, the merchant brought him rose-water in a copper dish that he\\nmight wash his hands, and ripe melons that he might quench his thirst,\\nand set a bowl of rice and a piece of roasted kid before him.\\n\\nAnd after that he had finished, the merchant led him to the\\nguest-chamber, and bade him sleep and be at rest.  And the young\\nFisherman gave him thanks, and kissed the ring that was on his hand, and\\nflung himself down on the carpets of dyed goat’s-hair.  And when he had\\ncovered himself with a covering of black lamb’s-wool he fell asleep.\\n\\nAnd three hours before dawn, and while it was still night, his Soul waked\\nhim and said to him, ‘Rise up and go to the room of the merchant, even to\\nthe room in which he sleepeth, and slay him, and take from him his gold,\\nfor we have need of it.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the\\nmerchant, and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved\\nsword, and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold.\\nAnd he reached out his hand and touched the sword, and when he touched it\\nthe merchant started and awoke, and leaping up seized himself the sword\\nand cried to the young Fisherman, ‘Dost thou return evil for good, and\\npay with the shedding of blood for the kindness that I have shown thee?’\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to the young Fisherman, ‘Strike him,’ and he struck him\\nso that he swooned and he seized then the nine purses of gold, and fled\\nhastily through the garden of pomegranates, and set his face to the star\\nthat is the star of morning.\\n\\nAnd when they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman beat\\nhis breast, and said to his Soul, ‘Why didst thou bid me slay the\\nmerchant and take his gold?  Surely thou art evil.’\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘I may not be at peace, for all that\\nthou hast made me to do I hate.  Thee also I hate, and I bid thee tell me\\nwherefore thou hast wrought with me in this wise.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘When thou didst send me forth into the world\\nthou gavest me no heart, so I learned to do all these things and love\\nthem.’\\n\\n‘What sayest thou?’ murmured the young Fisherman.\\n\\n‘Thou knowest,’ answered his Soul, ‘thou knowest it well.  Hast thou\\nforgotten that thou gavest me no heart?  I trow not.  And so trouble not\\nthyself nor me, but be at peace, for there is no pain that thou shalt not\\ngive away, nor any pleasure that thou shalt not receive.’\\n\\nAnd when the young Fisherman heard these words he trembled and said to\\nhis Soul, ‘Nay, but thou art evil, and hast made me forget my love, and\\nhast tempted me with temptations, and hast set my feet in the ways of\\nsin.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘Thou hast not forgotten that when thou didst\\nsend me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart.  Come, let us go to\\nanother city, and make merry, for we have nine purses of gold.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them\\ndown, and trampled on them.\\n\\n‘Nay,’ he cried, ‘but I will have nought to do with thee, nor will I\\njourney with thee anywhere, but even as I sent thee away before, so will\\nI send thee away now, for thou hast wrought me no good.’  And he turned\\nhis back to the moon, and with the little knife that had the handle of\\ngreen viper’s skin he strove to cut from his feet that shadow of the body\\nwhich is the body of the Soul.\\n\\nYet his Soul stirred not from him, nor paid heed to his command, but said\\nto him, ‘The spell that the Witch told thee avails thee no more, for I\\nmay not leave thee, nor mayest thou drive me forth.  Once in his life may\\na man send his Soul away, but he who receiveth back his Soul must keep it\\nwith him for ever, and this is his punishment and his reward.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and cried, ‘She\\nwas a false Witch in that she told me not that.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ answered his Soul, ‘but she was true to Him she worships, and\\nwhose servant she will be ever.’\\n\\nAnd when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his\\nSoul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with him always, he\\nfell upon the ground weeping bitterly.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, ‘I\\nwill bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that\\nI may not speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom\\nI love has her dwelling.  Even to the sea will I return, and to the\\nlittle bay where she is wont to sing, and I will call to her and tell her\\nthe evil I have done and the evil thou hast wrought on me.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul tempted him and said, ‘Who is thy love, that thou shouldst\\nreturn to her?  The world has many fairer than she is.  There are the\\ndancing-girls of Samaris who dance in the manner of all kinds of birds\\nand beasts.  Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they\\nhave little copper bells.  They laugh while they dance, and their\\nlaughter is as clear as the laughter of water.  Come with me and I will\\nshow them to thee.  For what is this trouble of thine about the things of\\nsin?  Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater?  Is there\\npoison in that which is sweet to drink?  Trouble not thyself, but come\\nwith me to another city.  There is a little city hard by in which there\\nis a garden of tulip-trees.  And there dwell in this comely garden white\\npeacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts.  Their tails when they\\nspread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks.  And\\nshe who feeds them dances for their pleasure, and sometimes she dances on\\nher hands and at other times she dances with her feet.  Her eyes are\\ncoloured with stibium, and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a\\nswallow.  From a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is\\ncarved out of a pearl.  She laughs while she dances, and the silver rings\\nthat are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver.  And so trouble\\nnot thyself any more, but come with me to this city.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but closed his lips with\\nthe seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his hands, and journeyed\\nback to the place from which he had come, even to the little bay where\\nhis love had been wont to sing.  And ever did his Soul tempt him by the\\nway, but he made it no answer, nor would he do any of the wickedness that\\nit sought to make him to do, so great was the power of the love that was\\nwithin him.\\n\\nAnd when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord from his\\nhands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and called to the\\nlittle Mermaid.  But she came not to his call, though he called to her\\nall day long and besought her.\\n\\nAnd his Soul mocked him and said, ‘Surely thou hast but little joy out of\\nthy love.  Thou art as one who in time of death pours water into a broken\\nvessel.  Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given to thee in\\nreturn.  It were better for thee to come with me, for I know where the\\nValley of Pleasure lies, and what things are wrought there.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of the rock\\nhe built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for the space of a\\nyear.  And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he\\ncalled to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.  Yet never did\\nshe rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he\\nfind her though he sought for her in the caves and in the green water, in\\nthe pools of the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the\\ndeep.\\n\\nAnd ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of terrible\\nthings.  Yet did it not prevail against him, so great was the power of\\nhis love.\\n\\nAnd after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, ‘I have\\ntempted my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I am.  I will\\ntempt him now with good, and it may be that he will come with me.’\\n\\nSo he spake to the young Fisherman and said, ‘I have told thee of the joy\\nof the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me.  Suffer me now to\\ntell thee of the world’s pain, and it may be that thou wilt hearken.  For\\nof a truth pain is the Lord of this world, nor is there any one who\\nescapes from its net.  There be some who lack raiment, and others who\\nlack bread.  There be widows who sit in purple, and widows who sit in\\nrags.  To and fro over the fens go the lepers, and they are cruel to each\\nother.  The beggars go up and down on the highways, and their wallets are\\nempty.  Through the streets of the cities walks Famine, and the Plague\\nsits at their gates.  Come, let us go forth and mend these things, and\\nmake them not to be.  Wherefore shouldst thou tarry here calling to thy\\nlove, seeing she comes not to thy call?  And what is love, that thou\\nshouldst set this high store upon it?’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the power of his\\nlove.  And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he\\ncalled to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.  Yet never did\\nshe rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he\\nfind her, though he sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the\\nvalleys that are under the waves, in the sea that the night makes purple,\\nand in the sea that the dawn leaves grey.\\n\\nAnd after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young Fisherman\\nat night-time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone, ‘Lo! now I have\\ntempted thee with evil, and I have tempted thee with good, and thy love\\nis stronger than I am.  Wherefore will I tempt thee no longer, but I pray\\nthee to suffer me to enter thy heart, that I may be one with thee even as\\nbefore.’\\n\\n‘Surely thou mayest enter,’ said the young Fisherman, ‘for in the days\\nwhen with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much\\nsuffered.’\\n\\n‘Alas!’ cried his Soul, ‘I can find no place of entrance, so compassed\\nabout with love is this heart of thine.’\\n\\n‘Yet I would that I could help thee,’ said the young Fisherman.\\n\\nAnd as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea, even the\\ncry that men hear when one of the Sea-folk is dead.  And the young\\nFisherman leapt up, and left his wattled house, and ran down to the\\nshore.  And the black waves came hurrying to the shore, bearing with them\\na burden that was whiter than silver.  White as the surf it was, and like\\na flower it tossed on the waves.  And the surf took it from the waves,\\nand the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying\\nat his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid.  Dead\\nat his feet it was lying.\\n\\nWeeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it, and he\\nkissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet amber of the\\nhair.  He flung himself down beside it on the sand, weeping as one\\ntrembling with joy, and in his brown arms he held it to his breast.  Cold\\nwere the lips, yet he kissed them.  Salt was the honey of the hair, yet\\nhe tasted it with a bitter joy.  He kissed the closed eyelids, and the\\nwild spray that lay upon their cups was less salt than his tears.\\n\\nAnd to the dead thing he made confession.  Into the shells of its ears he\\npoured the harsh wine of his tale.  He put the little hands round his\\nneck, and with his fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat.\\nBitter, bitter was his joy, and full of strange gladness was his pain.\\n\\nThe black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a leper.  With\\nwhite claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore.  From the palace of\\nthe Sea-King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the\\ngreat Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.\\n\\n‘Flee away,’ said his Soul, ‘for ever doth the sea come nigher, and if\\nthou tarriest it will slay thee.  Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that\\nthy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love.\\nFlee away to a place of safety.  Surely thou wilt not send me without a\\nheart into another world?’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the\\nlittle Mermaid and said, ‘Love is better than wisdom, and more precious\\nthan riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men.  The fires\\ncannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench it.  I called on thee at\\ndawn, and thou didst not come to my call.  The moon heard thy name, yet\\nhadst thou no heed of me.  For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt\\nhad I wandered away.  Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever was\\nit strong, nor did aught prevail against it, though I have looked upon\\nevil and looked upon good.  And now that thou art dead, surely I will die\\nwith thee also.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great was his\\nlove.  And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover him with its waves,\\nand when he knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the\\ncold lips of the Mermaid, and the heart that was within him brake.  And\\nas through the fulness of his love his heart did break, the Soul found an\\nentrance and entered in, and was one with him even as before.  And the\\nsea covered the young Fisherman with its waves.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for it had\\nbeen troubled.  And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the\\ncandle-bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.\\n\\nAnd when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman lying\\ndrowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of the little\\nMermaid.  And he drew back frowning, and having made the sign of the\\ncross, he cried aloud and said, ‘I will not bless the sea nor anything\\nthat is in it.  Accursed be the Sea-folk, and accursed be all they who\\ntraffic with them.  And as for him who for love’s sake forsook God, and\\nso lieth here with his leman slain by God’s judgment, take up his body\\nand the body of his leman, and bury them in the corner of the Field of\\nthe Fullers, and set no mark above them, nor sign of any kind, that none\\nmay know the place of their resting.  For accursed were they in their\\nlives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.’\\n\\nAnd the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field\\nof the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid\\nthe dead things within it.\\n\\nAnd when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy day, the\\nPriest went up to the chapel, that he might show to the people the wounds\\nof the Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of God.\\n\\nAnd when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and bowed\\nhimself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with strange\\nflowers that never had been seen before.  Strange were they to look at,\\nand of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was\\nsweet in his nostrils.  And he felt glad, and understood not why he was\\nglad.\\n\\nAnd after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the monstrance\\nthat was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it again\\nbehind the veil of veils, he began to speak to the people, desiring to\\nspeak to them of the wrath of God.  But the beauty of the white flowers\\ntroubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils, and there came\\nanother word into his lips, and he spake not of the wrath of God, but of\\nthe God whose name is Love.  And why he so spake, he knew not.\\n\\nAnd when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went\\nback to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears.  And the deacons\\ncame in and began to unrobe him, and took from him the alb and the\\ngirdle, the maniple and the stole.  And he stood as one in a dream.\\n\\nAnd after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, ‘What\\nare the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?’\\n\\nAnd they answered him, ‘What flowers they are we cannot tell, but they\\ncome from the corner of the Fullers’ Field.’  And the Priest trembled,\\nand returned to his own house and prayed.\\n\\nAnd in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with the monks\\nand the musicians, and the candle-bearers and the swingers of censers,\\nand a great company, and came to the shore of the sea, and blessed the\\nsea, and all the wild things that are in it.  The Fauns also he blessed,\\nand the little things that dance in the woodland, and the bright-eyed\\nthings that peer through the leaves.  All the things in God’s world he\\nblessed, and the people were filled with joy and wonder.  Yet never again\\nin the corner of the Fullers’ Field grew flowers of any kind, but the\\nfield remained barren even as before.  Nor came the Sea-folk into the bay\\nas they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE STAR-CHILD\\n\\n\\n                                    TO\\n                           MISS MARGOT TENNANT\\n                              [MRS. ASQUITH]\\n\\nONCE upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through\\na great pine-forest.  It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.  The\\nsnow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the\\nfrost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they\\npassed: and when they came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging\\nmotionless in air, for the Ice-King had kissed her.\\n\\nSo cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to\\nmake of it.\\n\\n‘Ugh!’ snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail\\nbetween his legs, ‘this is perfectly monstrous weather.  Why doesn’t the\\nGovernment look to it?’\\n\\n‘Weet! weet! weet!’ twittered the green Linnets, ‘the old Earth is dead\\nand they have laid her out in her white shroud.’\\n\\n‘The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,’\\nwhispered the Turtle-doves to each other.  Their little pink feet were\\nquite frost-bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a\\nromantic view of the situation.\\n\\n‘Nonsense!’ growled the Wolf.  ‘I tell you that it is all the fault of\\nthe Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.’  The Wolf\\nhad a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good\\nargument.\\n\\n‘Well, for my own part,’ said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher,\\n‘I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.  If a thing is so, it is\\nso, and at present it is terribly cold.’\\n\\nTerribly cold it certainly was.  The little Squirrels, who lived inside\\nthe tall fir-tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves\\nwarm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not\\nventure even to look out of doors.  The only people who seemed to enjoy\\nit were the great horned Owls.  Their feathers were quite stiff with\\nrime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and\\ncalled out to each other across the forest, ‘Tu-whit!  Tu-whoo!  Tu-whit!\\nTu-whoo! what delightful weather we are having!’\\n\\nOn and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers,\\nand stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the caked snow.  Once\\nthey sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when\\nthe stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice\\nwhere the marsh-water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their\\nbundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and\\nonce they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized\\non them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her\\narms.  But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches\\nover all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at\\nlast they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the\\nvalley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.\\n\\nSo overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and\\nthe Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a\\nflower of gold.\\n\\nYet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered\\ntheir poverty, and one of them said to the other, ‘Why did we make merry,\\nseeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?  Better\\nthat we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had\\nfallen upon us and slain us.’\\n\\n‘Truly,’ answered his companion, ‘much is given to some, and little is\\ngiven to others.  Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there\\nequal division of aught save of sorrow.’\\n\\nBut as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing\\nhappened.  There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.  It\\nslipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its\\ncourse, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink\\nbehind a clump of willow-trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no\\nmore than a stone’s-throw away.\\n\\n‘Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,’ they cried, and\\nthey set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.\\n\\nAnd one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced\\nhis way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo!\\nthere was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.  So he hastened\\ntowards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a\\ncloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many\\nfolds.  And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure\\nthat had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat\\nthem down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they\\nmight divide the pieces of gold.  But, alas! no gold was in it, nor\\nsilver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who\\nwas asleep.\\n\\nAnd one of them said to the other: ‘This is a bitter ending to our hope,\\nnor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?  Let\\nus leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have\\nchildren of our own whose bread we may not give to another.’\\n\\nBut his companion answered him: ‘Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave\\nthe child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou\\nart, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I\\nbring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.’\\n\\nSo very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to\\nshield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the\\nvillage, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of\\nheart.\\n\\nAnd when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, ‘Thou hast\\nthe child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should\\nshare.’\\n\\nBut he answered him: ‘Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but\\nthe child’s only,’ and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house\\nand knocked.\\n\\nAnd when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned\\nsafe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took\\nfrom his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots,\\nand bade him come in.\\n\\nBut he said to her, ‘I have found something in the forest, and I have\\nbrought it to thee to have care of it,’ and he stirred not from the\\nthreshold.\\n\\n‘What is it?’ she cried.  ‘Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we\\nhave need of many things.’  And he drew the cloak back, and showed her\\nthe sleeping child.\\n\\n‘Alack, goodman!’ she murmured, ‘have we not children of our own, that\\nthou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?  And who knows\\nif it will not bring us bad fortune?  And how shall we tend it?’  And she\\nwas wroth against him.\\n\\n‘Nay, but it is a Star-Child,’ he answered; and he told her the strange\\nmanner of the finding of it.\\n\\nBut she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and\\ncried: ‘Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?\\nWho is there who careth for us?  And who giveth us food?’\\n\\n‘Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,’ he\\nanswered.\\n\\n‘Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?’ she asked.  ‘And is it\\nnot winter now?’\\n\\nAnd the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.\\n\\nAnd a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made\\nher tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: ‘Wilt thou not close the\\ndoor?  There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.’\\n\\n‘Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter\\nwind?’ he asked.  And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to\\nthe fire.\\n\\nAnd after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were\\nfull of tears.  And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms,\\nand she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of\\ntheir own children was lying.  And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the\\ncurious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of\\namber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the\\nchest also.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nSo the Star-Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and\\nsat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.  And every year\\nhe became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the\\nvillage were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and\\nblack-haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were\\nlike the rings of the daffodil.  His lips, also, were like the petals of\\na red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water,\\nand his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.\\n\\nYet did his beauty work him evil.  For he grew proud, and cruel, and\\nselfish.  The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the\\nvillage, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he\\nwas noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over\\nthem, and called them his servants.  No pity had he for the poor, or for\\nthose who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast\\nstones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg\\ntheir bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that\\nvillage to ask for alms.  Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and\\nwould mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make jest of them; and\\nhimself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie\\nby the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his\\nown face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.\\n\\nOften did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: ‘We did not\\ndeal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have\\nnone to succour them.  Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?’\\n\\nOften did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of\\nliving things, saying to him: ‘The fly is thy brother.  Do it no harm.\\nThe wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.  Snare\\nthem not for thy pleasure.  God made the blind-worm and the mole, and\\neach has its place.  Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?  Even\\nthe cattle of the field praise Him.’\\n\\nBut the Star-Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and\\ngo back to his companions, and lead them.  And his companions followed\\nhim, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and\\nmake music.  And wherever the Star-Child led them they followed, and\\nwhatever the Star-Child bade them do, that did they.  And when he pierced\\nwith a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he\\ncast stones at the leper they laughed also.  And in all things he ruled\\nthem, and they became hard of heart even as he was.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow there passed one day through the village a poor beggar-woman.  Her\\ngarments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough\\nroad on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.  And\\nbeing weary she sat her down under a chestnut-tree to rest.\\n\\nBut when the Star-Child saw her, he said to his companions, ‘See!  There\\nsitteth a foul beggar-woman under that fair and green-leaved tree.  Come,\\nlet us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill-favoured.’\\n\\nSo he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked\\nat him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.  And\\nwhen the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what\\nthe Star-Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him:\\n‘Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has\\nthis poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the\\nground, and said, ‘Who art thou to question me what I do?  I am no son of\\nthine to do thy bidding.’\\n\\n‘Thou speakest truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘yet did I show thee pity\\nwhen I found thee in the forest.’\\n\\nAnd when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a\\nswoon.  And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had\\ncare of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had\\nfallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.\\n\\nBut she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, ‘Didst\\nthou not say that the child was found in the forest?  And was it not ten\\nyears from this day?’\\n\\nAnd the Woodcutter answered, ‘Yea, it was in the forest that I found him,\\nand it is ten years from this day.’\\n\\n‘And what signs didst thou find with him?’ she cried.  ‘Bare he not upon\\nhis neck a chain of amber?  Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue\\nbroidered with stars?’\\n\\n‘Truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘it was even as thou sayest.’  And he\\ntook the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and\\nshowed them to her.\\n\\nAnd when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, ‘He is my little son\\nwhom I lost in the forest.  I pray thee send for him quickly, for in\\nsearch of him have I wandered over the whole world.’\\n\\nSo the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star-Child, and\\nsaid to him, ‘Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother,\\nwho is waiting for thee.’\\n\\nSo he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.  But when he saw her\\nwho was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, ‘Why, where is my\\nmother?  For I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.’\\n\\nAnd the woman answered him, ‘I am thy mother.’\\n\\n‘Thou art mad to say so,’ cried the Star-Child angrily.  ‘I am no son of\\nthine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.  Therefore get thee\\nhence, and let me see thy foul face no more.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,’ she\\ncried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.  ‘The\\nrobbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,’ she murmured, ‘but I\\nrecognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised,\\nthe cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.  Therefore I pray thee\\ncome with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.\\nCome with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.’\\n\\nBut the Star-Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his\\nheart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the\\nwoman weeping for pain.\\n\\nAnd at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.  ‘If in\\nvery truth thou art my mother,’ he said, ‘it had been better hadst thou\\nstayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I\\nthought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou\\ntellest me that I am.  Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no\\nmore.’\\n\\n‘Alas! my son,’ she cried, ‘wilt thou not kiss me before I go?  For I\\nhave suffered much to find thee.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ said the Star-Child, ‘but thou art too foul to look at, and rather\\nwould I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.’\\n\\nSo the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and\\nwhen the Star-Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to\\nhis playmates that he might play with them.\\n\\nBut when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, ‘Why, thou art\\nas foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.  Get thee hence, for\\nwe will not suffer thee to play with us,’ and they drave him out of the\\ngarden.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child frowned and said to himself, ‘What is this that they\\nsay to me?  I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall\\ntell me of my beauty.’\\n\\nSo he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was\\nas the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.  And he\\nflung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, ‘Surely\\nthis has come upon me by reason of my sin.  For I have denied my mother,\\nand driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.  Wherefore I will\\ngo and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have\\nfound her.’\\n\\nAnd there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put\\nher hand upon his shoulder and said, ‘What doth it matter if thou hast\\nlost thy comeliness?  Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.’\\n\\nAnd he said to her, ‘Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a\\npunishment has this evil been sent to me.  Wherefore I must go hence, and\\nwander through the world till I find her, and she give me her\\nforgiveness.’\\n\\nSo he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to\\nhim, but there was no answer.  All day long he called to her, and, when\\nthe sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and\\nthe animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was\\nalone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled\\npast.\\n\\nAnd in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the\\ntrees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping\\nsorely.  And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they\\nhad seen his mother.\\n\\nHe said to the Mole, ‘Thou canst go beneath the earth.  Tell me, is my\\nmother there?’\\n\\nAnd the Mole answered, ‘Thou hast blinded mine eyes.  How should I know?’\\n\\nHe said to the Linnet, ‘Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees,\\nand canst see the whole world.  Tell me, canst thou see my mother?’\\n\\nAnd the Linnet answered, ‘Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.  How\\nshould I fly?’\\n\\nAnd to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir-tree, and was lonely, he\\nsaid, ‘Where is my mother?’\\n\\nAnd the Squirrel answered, ‘Thou hast slain mine.  Dost thou seek to slay\\nthine also?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of\\nGod’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the\\nbeggar-woman.  And on the third day he came to the other side of the\\nforest and went down into the plain.\\n\\nAnd when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and\\nthrew stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep\\nin the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was\\nhe to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who\\nhad pity on him.  Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar-woman who was\\nhis mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the\\nworld, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would\\ncall to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to\\nbleed.  But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did\\never deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport\\nof his sorrow.\\n\\nFor the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world\\nthere was neither love nor loving-kindness nor charity for him, but it\\nwas even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great\\npride.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd one evening he came to the gate of a strong-walled city that stood by\\na river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.  But\\nthe soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the\\nentrance, and said roughly to him, ‘What is thy business in the city?’\\n\\n‘I am seeking for my mother,’ he answered, ‘and I pray ye to suffer me to\\npass, for it may be that she is in this city.’\\n\\nBut they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set\\ndown his shield and cried, ‘Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when\\nshe sees thee, for thou art more ill-favoured than the toad of the marsh,\\nor the adder that crawls in the fen.  Get thee gone.  Get thee gone.  Thy\\nmother dwells not in this city.’\\n\\nAnd another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, ‘Who is\\nthy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?’\\n\\nAnd he answered, ‘My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated\\nher evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her\\nforgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.’  But they would\\nnot, and pricked him with their spears.\\n\\nAnd, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt\\nflowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and\\nmade inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.  And\\nthey said to him, ‘It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have\\ndriven him away.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ he cried, laughing, ‘but we will sell the foul thing for a slave,\\nand his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.’\\n\\nAnd an old and evil-visaged man who was passing by called out, and said,\\n‘I will buy him for that price,’ and, when he had paid the price, he took\\nthe Star-Child by the hand and led him into the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little\\ndoor that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.\\nAnd the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it\\nopened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with\\nblack poppies and green jars of burnt clay.  And the old man took then\\nfrom his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of\\nthe Star-Child, and drave him in front of him.  And when the scarf was\\ntaken off his eyes, the Star-Child found himself in a dungeon, that was\\nlit by a lantern of horn.\\n\\nAnd the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said,\\n‘Eat,’ and some brackish water in a cup and said, ‘Drink,’ and when he\\nhad eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him\\nand fastening it with an iron chain.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the\\nmagicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the\\ntombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, ‘In a\\nwood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three\\npieces of gold.  One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and\\nthe gold of the third one is red.  To-day thou shalt bring me the piece\\nof white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a\\nhundred stripes.  Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting\\nfor thee at the door of the garden.  See that thou bringest the white\\ngold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have\\nbought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.’  And he bound the\\neyes of the Star-Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him\\nthrough the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five\\nsteps of brass.  And having opened the little door with his ring he set\\nhim in the street.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood\\nof which the Magician had spoken to him.\\n\\nNow this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of\\nsinging birds and of sweet-scented flowers, and the Star-Child entered it\\ngladly.  Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh\\nbriars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil\\nnettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that\\nhe was in sore distress.  Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white\\ngold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn\\nto noon, and from noon to sunset.  And at sunset he set his face towards\\nhome, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.\\n\\nBut when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a\\nthicket a cry as of some one in pain.  And forgetting his own sorrow he\\nran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that\\nsome hunter had set for it.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, ‘I am\\nmyself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.’\\n\\nAnd the Hare answered him, and said: ‘Surely thou hast given me freedom,\\nand what shall I give thee in return?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child said to it, ‘I am seeking for a piece of white gold,\\nnor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will\\nbeat me.’\\n\\n‘Come thou with me,’ said the Hare, ‘and I will lead thee to it, for I\\nknow where it is hidden, and for what purpose.’\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great\\noak-tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.  And he was\\nfilled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, ‘The service that I\\ndid to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the\\nkindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred-fold.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ answered the Hare, ‘but as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with\\nthee,’ and it ran away swiftly, and the Star-Child went towards the city.\\n\\nNow at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.  Over\\nhis face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes\\ngleamed like red coals.  And when he saw the Star-Child coming, he struck\\nupon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and\\nsaid, ‘Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.  For they have\\nthrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.’\\n\\n‘Alas!’ cried the Star-Child, ‘I have but one piece of money in my\\nwallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his\\nslave.’\\n\\nBut the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star-Child had\\npity, and gave him the piece of white gold.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and\\nbrought him in, and said to him, ‘Hast thou the piece of white gold?’\\nAnd the Star-Child answered, ‘I have it not.’  So the Magician fell upon\\nhim, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, ‘Eat,’\\nand an empty cup, and said, ‘Drink,’ and flung him again into the\\ndungeon.\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‘If to-day thou\\nbringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my\\nslave, and give thee three hundred stripes.’\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the\\npiece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.  And at sunset he sat\\nhim down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the\\nlittle Hare that he had rescued from the trap.\\n\\nAnd the Hare said to him, ‘Why art thou weeping?  And what dost thou seek\\nin the wood?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child answered, ‘I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold\\nthat is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and\\nkeep me as a slave.’\\n\\n‘Follow me,’ cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to\\na pool of water.  And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold\\nwas lying.\\n\\n‘How shall I thank thee?’ said the Star-Child, ‘for lo! this is the\\nsecond time that you have succoured me.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,’ said the Hare, and it ran away\\nswiftly.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his\\nwallet, and hurried to the city.  But the leper saw him coming, and ran\\nto meet him, and knelt down and cried, ‘Give me a piece of money or I\\nshall die of hunger.’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child said to him, ‘I have in my wallet but one piece of\\nyellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep\\nme as his slave.’\\n\\nBut the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star-Child had pity on him,\\nand gave him the piece of yellow gold.\\n\\nAnd when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and\\nbrought him in, and said to him, ‘Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?’\\nAnd the Star-Child said to him, ‘I have it not.’  So the Magician fell\\nupon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again\\ninto the dungeon.\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‘If to-day thou\\nbringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou\\nbringest it not I will surely slay thee.’\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the\\npiece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.  And at evening he sat\\nhim down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little\\nHare.\\n\\nAnd the Hare said to him, ‘The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in\\nthe cavern that is behind thee.  Therefore weep no more but be glad.’\\n\\n‘How shall I reward thee?’ cried the Star-Child, ‘for lo! this is the\\nthird time thou hast succoured me.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,’ said the Hare, and it ran away\\nswiftly.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he\\nfound the piece of red gold.  So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to\\nthe city.  And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the\\nroad, and cried out, and said to him, ‘Give me the piece of red money, or\\nI must die,’ and the Star-Child had pity on him again, and gave him the\\npiece of red gold, saying, ‘Thy need is greater than mine.’  Yet was his\\nheart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nBut lo! as he passed through the gate of the city, the guards bowed down\\nand made obeisance to him, saying, ‘How beautiful is our lord!’ and a\\ncrowd of citizens followed him, and cried out, ‘Surely there is none so\\nbeautiful in the whole world!’ so that the Star-Child wept, and said to\\nhimself, ‘They are mocking me, and making light of my misery.’  And so\\nlarge was the concourse of the people, that he lost the threads of his\\nway, and found himself at last in a great square, in which there was a\\npalace of a King.\\n\\nAnd the gate of the palace opened, and the priests and the high officers\\nof the city ran forth to meet him, and they abased themselves before him,\\nand said, ‘Thou art our lord for whom we have been waiting, and the son\\nof our King.’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child answered them and said, ‘I am no king’s son, but the\\nchild of a poor beggar-woman.  And how say ye that I am beautiful, for I\\nknow that I am evil to look at?’\\n\\nThen he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet\\ncrouched a lion that had wings, held up a shield, and cried, ‘How saith\\nmy lord that he is not beautiful?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and\\nhis comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he\\nhad not seen there before.\\n\\nAnd the priests and the high officers knelt down and said to him, ‘It was\\nprophesied of old that on this day should come he who was to rule over\\nus.  Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in\\nhis justice and mercy our King over us.’\\n\\nBut he said to them, ‘I am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who\\nbare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.\\nTherefore, let me go, for I must wander again over the world, and may not\\ntarry here, though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre.’  And as he\\nspake he turned his face from them towards the street that led to the\\ngate of the city, and lo! amongst the crowd that pressed round the\\nsoldiers, he saw the beggar-woman who was his mother, and at her side\\nstood the leper, who had sat by the road.\\n\\nAnd a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and kneeling down\\nhe kissed the wounds on his mother’s feet, and wet them with his tears.\\nHe bowed his head in the dust, and sobbing, as one whose heart might\\nbreak, he said to her: ‘Mother, I denied thee in the hour of my pride.\\nAccept me in the hour of my humility.  Mother, I gave thee hatred.  Do\\nthou give me love.  Mother, I rejected thee.  Receive thy child now.’\\nBut the beggar-woman answered him not a word.\\n\\nAnd he reached out his hands, and clasped the white feet of the leper,\\nand said to him: ‘Thrice did I give thee of my mercy.  Bid my mother\\nspeak to me once.’  But the leper answered him not a word.\\n\\nAnd he sobbed again and said: ‘Mother, my suffering is greater than I can\\nbear.  Give me thy forgiveness, and let me go back to the forest.’  And\\nthe beggar-woman put her hand on his head, and said to him, ‘Rise,’ and\\nthe leper put his hand on his head, and said to him, ‘Rise,’ also.\\n\\nAnd he rose up from his feet, and looked at them, and lo! they were a\\nKing and a Queen.\\n\\nAnd the Queen said to him, ‘This is thy father whom thou hast succoured.’\\n\\nAnd the King said, ‘This is thy mother whose feet thou hast washed with\\nthy tears.’  And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and brought him\\ninto the palace and clothed him in fair raiment, and set the crown upon\\nhis head, and the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that stood by\\nthe river he ruled, and was its lord.  Much justice and mercy did he show\\nto all, and the evil Magician he banished, and to the Woodcutter and his\\nwife he sent many rich gifts, and to their children he gave high honour.\\nNor would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast, but taught love and\\nloving-kindness and charity, and to the poor he gave bread, and to the\\nnaked he gave raiment, and there was peace and plenty in the land.\\n\\nYet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so bitter the\\nfire of his testing, for after the space of three years he died.  And he\\nwho came after him ruled evilly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A HOUSE OF POMEGRANATES***\\n\\n\\n******* This file should be named 873-0.txt or 873-0.zip *******\\n\\n\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/8/7/873\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

It is scarcely realised by the present generation that Wilde’s\\nworks on their first appearance, with the exception of _De Profundis_,\\nwere met with almost general condemnation and ridicule.  The plays on\\ntheir first production were grudgingly praised because their obvious\\nsuccess could not be ignored; but on their subsequent publication in book\\nform they were violently assailed.  That nearly all of them have held the\\nstage is still a source of irritation among certain journalists.\\n_Salomé_ however enjoys a singular career.  As every one knows, it was\\nprohibited by the Censor when in rehearsal by Madame Bernhardt at the\\nPalace Theatre in 1892.  On its publication in 1893 it was greeted with\\ngreater abuse than any other of Wilde’s works, and was consigned to the\\nusual irrevocable oblivion.  The accuracy of the French was freely\\ncanvassed, and of course it is obvious that the French is not that of a\\nFrenchman.  The play was passed for press, however, by no less a writer\\nthan Marcel Schwob whose letter to the Paris publisher, returning the\\nproofs and mentioning two or three slight alterations, is still in my\\npossession.  Marcel Schwob told me some years afterwards that he thought\\nit would have spoiled the spontaneity and character of Wilde’s style if\\nhe had tried to harmonise it with the diction demanded by the French\\nAcademy.  It was never composed with any idea of presentation.  Madame\\nBernhardt happened to say she wished Wilde would write a play for her; he\\nreplied in jest that he had done so.  She insisted on seeing the\\nmanuscript, and decided on its immediate production, ignorant or\\nforgetful of the English law which prohibits the introduction of\\nScriptural characters on the stage.  With his keen sense of the theatre\\nWilde would never have contrived the long speech of Salomé at the end in\\na drama intended for the stage, even in the days of long speeches.  His\\nthreat to change his nationality shortly after the Censor’s interference\\ncalled forth a most delightful and good-natured caricature of him by Mr.\\nBernard Partridge in _Punch_.\\n\\nWilde was still in prison in 1896 when _Salomé_ was produced by Lugne Poë\\nat the Théàtre de L’Œuvre in Paris, but except for an account in the\\n_Daily Telegraph_ the incident was hardly mentioned in England.  I gather\\nthat the performance was only a qualified success, though Lugne Poë’s\\ntriumph as Herod was generally acknowledged.  In 1901, within a year of\\nthe author’s death, it was produced in Berlin; from that moment it has\\nheld the European stage.  It has run for a longer consecutive period in\\nGermany than any play by any Englishman, not excepting Shakespeare.  Its\\npopularity has extended to all countries where it is not prohibited.  It\\nis performed throughout Europe, Asia and America.  It is played even in\\nYiddish.  This is remarkable in view of the many dramas by French and\\nGerman writers who treat of the same theme.  To none of them, however, is\\nWilde indebted.  Flaubert, Maeterlinck (some would add Ollendorff) and\\nScripture, are the obvious sources on which he has freely drawn for what\\nI do not hesitate to call the most powerful and perfect of all his\\ndramas.  But on such a point a trustee and executor may be prejudiced\\nbecause it is the most valuable asset in Wilde’s literary estate.  Aubrey\\nBeardsley’s illustrations are too well known to need more than a passing\\nreference.  In the world of art criticism they excited almost as much\\nattention as Wilde’s drama has excited in the world of intellect.\\n\\nDuring May 1905 the play was produced in England for the first time at a\\nprivate performance by the New Stage Club.  No one present will have\\nforgotten the extraordinary tension of the audience on that occasion,\\nthose who disliked the play and its author being hypnotised by the\\nextraordinary power of Mr. Robert Farquharson’s Herod, one of the finest\\npieces of acting ever seen in this country.  My friends the dramatic\\ncritics (and many of them are personal friends) fell on _Salomé_ with all\\nthe vigour of their predecessors twelve years before.  Unaware of what\\nwas taking place in Germany, they spoke of the play as having been\\n‘dragged from obscurity.’  The Official Receiver in Bankruptcy and myself\\nwere, however, better informed.  And much pleasure has been derived from\\nreading those criticisms, all carefully preserved along with the list of\\nreceipts which were simultaneously pouring in from the German\\nperformances.  To do the critics justice they never withdrew any of their\\nprinted opinions, which were all trotted out again when the play was\\nproduced privately for the second time in England by the Literary Theatre\\nSociety in 1906.  In the _Speaker_ of July 14th, 1906, however, some of\\nthe iterated misrepresentations of fact were corrected.  No attempt was\\nmade to controvert the opinion of an ignorant critic: his veracity only\\nwas impugned.  The powers of vaticination possessed by such judges of\\ndrama can be fairly tested in the career of _Salomé_ on the European\\nstage, apart from the opera.  In an introduction to the English\\ntranslation published by Mr. John Lane it is pointed out that Wilde’s\\nconfusion of Herod Antipas (Matt. xiv. 1) with Herod the Great (Matt. ii.\\n1) and Herod Agrippa I. (Acts xii. 23) is intentional, and follows a\\nmediæval convention.  There is no attempt at historical accuracy or\\narchæological exactness.  Those who saw the marvellous _décor_ of Mr.\\nCharles Ricketts at the second English production can form a complete\\nidea of what Wilde intended in that respect; although the stage\\nmanagement was clumsy and amateurish.  The great opera of Richard Strauss\\ndoes not fall within my province; but the fag ends of its popularity on\\nthe Continent have been imported here oddly enough through the agency of\\nthe Palace Theatre, where _Salomé_ was originally to have been performed.\\nOf a young lady’s dancing, or of that of her rivals, I am not qualified\\nto speak.  I note merely that the critics who objected to the horror of\\none incident in the drama lost all self-control on seeing that incident\\nrepeated in dumb show and accompanied by fescennine corybantics.  Except\\nin ‘name and borrowed notoriety’ the music-hall sensation has no relation\\nwhatever to the drama which so profoundly moved the whole of Europe and\\nthe greatest living musician.  The adjectives of contumely are easily\\ntransmuted into epithets of adulation, when a prominent ecclesiastic\\nsuccumbs, like King Herod, to the fascination of a dancer.\\n\\nIt is not usually known in England that a young French naval officer,\\nunaware that Dr. Strauss was composing an opera on the theme of _Salomé_,\\nwrote another music drama to accompany Wilde’s text.  The exclusive\\nmusical rights having been already secured by Dr. Strauss, Lieutenant\\nMarriotte’s work cannot be performed regularly.  One presentation,\\nhowever, was permitted at Lyons, the composer’s native town, where I am\\ntold it made an extraordinary impression.  In order to give English\\nreaders some faint idea of the world-wide effect of Wilde’s drama, my\\nfriend Mr. Walter Ledger has prepared a short bibliography of certain\\nEnglish and Continental translations.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAt the time of Wilde’s trial the nearly completed MS. of _La Sainte\\nCourtisane_ was entrusted to Mrs. Leverson, the well-known novelist, who\\nin 1897 went to Paris on purpose to restore it to the author.  Wilde\\nimmediately left the only copy in a cab.  A few days later he laughingly\\ninformed me of the loss, and added that a cab was a very proper place for\\nit.  I have explained elsewhere that he looked on his works with disdain\\nin his last years, though he was always full of schemes for writing\\nothers.  All my attempts to recover the lost work failed.  The passages\\nhere reprinted are from some odd leaves of a first draft.  The play is,\\nof course, not unlike _Salomé_, though it was written in English.  It\\nexpanded Wilde’s favourite theory that when you convert some one to an\\nidea, you lose your faith in it; the same motive runs through _Mr. W. H._\\nHonorius the hermit, so far as I recollect the story, falls in love with\\nthe courtesan who has come to tempt him, and he reveals to her the secret\\nof the love of God.  She immediately becomes a Christian, and is murdered\\nby robbers.  Honorius the hermit goes back to Alexandria to pursue a life\\nof pleasure.  Two other similar plays Wilde invented in prison, _Ahab and\\nIsabel_ and _Pharaoh_; he would never write them down, though often\\nimportuned to do so.  _Pharaoh_ was intensely dramatic and perhaps more\\noriginal than any of the group.  None of these works must be confused\\nwith the manuscripts stolen from 16 Tite Street in 1895—namely, the\\nenlarged version of _Mr. W. H._, the second draft of _A Florentine\\nTragedy_, and _The Duchess of Padua_ (which, existing in a prompt copy,\\nwas of less importance than the others); nor with _The Cardinal of\\nArragon_, the manuscript of which I never saw.  I scarcely think it ever\\nexisted, though Wilde used to recite proposed passages for it.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nSome years after Wilde’s death I was looking over the papers and letters\\nrescued from Tite Street when I came across loose sheets of manuscript\\nand typewriting, which I imagined were fragments of _The Duchess of\\nPadua_; on putting them together in a coherent form I recognised that\\nthey belonged to the lost _Florentine Tragedy_.  I assumed that the\\nopening scene, though once extant, had disappeared.  One day, however,\\nMr. Willard wrote that he possessed a typewritten fragment of a play\\nwhich Wilde had submitted to him, and this he kindly forwarded for my\\ninspection.  It agreed in nearly every particular with what I had taken\\nso much trouble to put together.  This suggests that the opening scene\\nhad never been written, as Mr. Willard’s version began where mine did.\\nIt was characteristic of the author to finish what he never began.\\n\\nWhen the Literary Theatre Society produced _Salomé_ in 1906 they asked me\\nfor some other short drama by Wilde to present at the same time, as\\n_Salomé_ does not take very long to play.  I offered them the fragment of\\n_A Florentine Tragedy_.  By a fortunate coincidence the poet and\\ndramatist, Mr. Thomas Sturge Moore, happened to be on the committee of\\nthis Society, and to him was entrusted the task of writing an opening\\nscene to make the play complete.  It is not for me to criticise his work,\\nbut there is justification for saying that Wilde himself would have\\nenvied, with an artist’s envy, such lines as—\\n\\n    We will sup with the moon,\\n    Like Persian princes that in Babylon\\n    Sup in the hanging gardens of the King.\\n\\nIn a stylistic sense Mr. Sturge Moore has accomplished a feat in\\nreconstruction, whatever opinions may be held of _A Florentine Tragedy_\\nby Wilde’s admirers or detractors.  The achievement is particularly\\nremarkable because Mr. Sturge Moore has nothing in common with Wilde\\nother than what is shared by all real poets and dramatists: He is a\\nlanded proprietor on Parnassus, not a trespasser.  In England we are more\\nfamiliar with the poachers.  Time and Death are of course necessary\\nbefore there can come any adequate recognition of one of our most\\noriginal and gifted singers.  Among his works are _The Vinedresser and\\nother Poems_ (1899), _Absalom_, _A Chronicle Play_ (1903), and _The\\nCentaur’s Booty_ (1903).  Mr. Sturge Moore is also an art critic of\\ndistinction, and his learned works on Dürer (1905) and Correggio (1906)\\nare more widely known (I am sorry to say) than his powerful and\\nenthralling poems.\\n\\nOnce again I must express my obligations to Mr. Stuart Mason for revising\\nand correcting the proofs of this new edition.\\n\\n                                                               ROBERT ROSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLA SAINTE COURTISANE\\nA FRAGMENT\\n\\n_First Published in Book Form by Methuen and    _October_       _1908_\\nCo. in_ ‘_Miscellanies_’ (_Limited Editions\\non handmade paper and Japanese Vellum_)\\n_First F’cap. 8vo Edition_                      _November_      _1909_\\n_Second F’cap. 8vo Edition_                     _October_       _1910_\\n_Third F’cap. 8vo Edition_                      _December_      _1911_\\n_Fourth F’cap. 8vo Edition_                     _May_           _1915_\\n_Fifth F’cap. 8vo Edition_                              _1917_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLA SAINTE COURTISANE\\nOR, THE WOMAN COVERED WITH JEWELS\\n\\n\\n_The scene represents the corner of a valley in the Thebaid_.  _On the\\nright hand of the stage is a cavern.

It is like corn in spring when she stands\\nstill.  It is like young corn troubled by the shadows of hawks when she\\nmoves.  The pearls on her tunic are like many moons.\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  They are like the moons one sees in the water when the wind\\nblows from the hills.\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  I think she is one of the gods.  I think she comes from\\nNubia.\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  I am sure she is the daughter of the Emperor.  Her nails are\\nstained with henna.  They are like the petals of a rose.  She has come\\nhere to weep for Adonis.\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  She is one of the gods.  I do not know why she has left her\\ntemple.  The gods should not leave their temples.  If she speaks to us\\nlet us not answer, and she will pass by.\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  She will not speak to us.  She is the daughter of the\\nEmperor.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Dwells he not here, the beautiful young hermit, he who will\\nnot look on the face of woman?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  Of a truth it is here the hermit dwells.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Why will he not look on the face of woman?\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  We do not know.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Why do ye yourselves not look at me?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  You are covered with bright stones, and you dazzle our eyes.\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  He who looks at the sun becomes blind.  You are too bright\\nto look at.  It is not wise to look at things that are very bright.  Many\\nof the priests in the temples are blind, and have slaves to lead them.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Where does he dwell, the beautiful young hermit who will not\\nlook on the face of woman?  Has he a house of reeds or a house of burnt\\nclay or does he lie on the hillside?  Or does he make his bed in the\\nrushes?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  He dwells in that cavern yonder.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  What a curious place to dwell in!\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  Of old a centaur lived there.  When the hermit came the\\ncentaur gave a shrill cry, wept and lamented, and galloped away.\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  No.  It was a white unicorn who lived in the cave.  When it\\nsaw the hermit coming the unicorn knelt down and worshipped him.  Many\\npeople saw it worshipping him.\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  I have talked with people who saw it.\\n\\n                                . . . . .\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  Some say he was a hewer of wood and worked for hire.  But\\nthat may not be true.\\n\\n                                . . . . .\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  What gods then do ye worship?  Or do ye worship any gods?\\nThere are those who have no gods to worship.  The philosophers who wear\\nlong beards and brown cloaks have no gods to worship.  They wrangle with\\neach other in the porticoes.  The [ ] laugh at them.\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  We worship seven gods.  We may not tell their names.  It is a\\nvery dangerous thing to tell the names of the gods.  No one should ever\\ntell the name of his god.  Even the priests who praise the gods all day\\nlong, and eat of their food with them, do not call them by their right\\nnames.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Where are these gods ye worship?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  We hide them in the folds of our tunics.  We do not show them\\nto any one.  If we showed them to any one they might leave us.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Where did ye meet with them?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  They were given to us by an embalmer of the dead who had\\nfound them in a tomb.  We served him for seven years.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  The dead are terrible.  I am afraid of Death.\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  Death is not a god.  He is only the servant of the gods.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  He is the only god I am afraid of.  Ye have seen many of the\\ngods?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  We have seen many of them.  One sees them chiefly at night\\ntime.  They pass one by very swiftly.  Once we saw some of the gods at\\ndaybreak.  They were walking across a plain.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Once as I was passing through the market place I heard a\\nsophist from Cilicia say that there is only one God.  He said it before\\nmany people.\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  That cannot be true.  We have ourselves seen many, though we\\nare but common men and of no account.  When I saw them I hid myself in a\\nbush.  They did me no harm.\\n\\n                                . . . . .\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Tell me more about the beautiful young hermit.  Talk to me\\nabout the beautiful young hermit who will not look on the face of woman.\\nWhat is the story of his days?  What mode of life has he?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  We do not understand you.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  What does he do, the beautiful young hermit?  Does he sow or\\nreap?  Does he plant a garden or catch fish in a net?  Does he weave\\nlinen on a loom?  Does he set his hand to the wooden plough and walk\\nbehind the oxen?\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  He being a very holy man does nothing.  We are common men\\nand of no account.  We toll all day long in the sun.  Sometimes the\\nground is very hard.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Do the birds of the air feed him?  Do the jackals share their\\nbooty with him?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  Every evening we bring him food.  We do not think that the\\nbirds of the air feed him.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Why do ye feed him?  What profit have ye in so doing?\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  He is a very holy man.  One of the gods whom he has offended\\nhas made him mad.  We think he has offended the moon.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Go and tell him that one who has come from Alexandria desires\\nto speak with him.\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  We dare not tell him.  This hour he is praying to his God.\\nWe pray thee to pardon us for not doing thy bidding.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Are ye afraid, of him?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  We are afraid of him.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Why are ye afraid of him?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  We do not know.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  What is his name?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  The voice that speaks to him at night time in the cavern\\ncalls to him by the name of Honorius.  It was also by the name of\\nHonorius that the three lepers who passed by once called to him.  We\\nthink that his name is Honorius.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Why did the three lepers call to him?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  That he might heal them.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Did he heal them?\\n\\nSECOND MAN.  No.  They had committed some sin: it was for that reason\\nthey were lepers.  Their hands and faces were like salt.  One of them\\nwore a mask of linen.  He was a king’s son.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  What is the voice that speaks to him at night time in his\\ncave?\\n\\nFIRST MAN.  We do not know whose voice it is.  We think it is the voice\\nof his God.  For we have seen no man enter his cavern nor any come forth\\nfrom it.\\n\\n                                . . . . .\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Honorius.\\n\\nHONORIUS (_from within_).  Who calls Honorius?\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Come forth, Honorius.\\n\\n                                . . . . .\\n\\nMy chamber is ceiled with cedar and odorous with myrrh.  The pillars of\\nmy bed are of cedar and the hangings are of purple.  My bed is strewn\\nwith purple and the steps are of silver.  The hangings are sewn with\\nsilver pomegranates and the steps that are of silver are strewn with\\nsaffron and with myrrh.  My lovers hang garlands round the pillars of my\\nhouse.  At night time they come with the flute players and the players of\\nthe harp.  They woo me with apples and on the pavement of my courtyard\\nthey write my name in wine.\\n\\nFrom the uttermost parts of the world my lovers come to me.  The kings of\\nthe earth come to me and bring me presents.\\n\\nWhen the Emperor of Byzantium heard of me he left his porphyry chamber\\nand set sail in his galleys.  His slaves bare no torches that none might\\nknow of his coming.  When the King of Cyprus heard of me he sent me\\nambassadors.  The two Kings of Libya who are brothers brought me gifts of\\namber.\\n\\nI took the minion of Cæsar from Cæsar and made him my playfellow.  He\\ncame to me at night in a litter.  He was pale as a narcissus, and his\\nbody was like honey.\\n\\nThe son of the Præfect slew himself in my honour, and the Tetrarch of\\nCilicia scourged himself for my pleasure before my slaves.\\n\\nThe King of Hierapolis who is a priest and a robber set carpets for me to\\nwalk on.\\n\\nSometimes I sit in the circus and the gladiators fight beneath me.  Once\\na Thracian who was my lover was caught in the net.  I gave the signal for\\nhim to die and the whole theatre applauded.  Sometimes I pass through the\\ngymnasium and watch the young men wrestling or in the race.  Their bodies\\nare bright with oil and their brows are wreathed with willow sprays and\\nwith myrtle.  They stamp their feet on the sand when they wrestle and\\nwhen they run the sand follows them like a little cloud.  He at whom I\\nsmile leaves his companions and follows me to my home.  At other times I\\ngo down to the harbour and watch the merchants unloading their vessels.\\nThose that come from Tyre have cloaks of silk and earrings of emerald.\\nThose that come from Massilia have cloaks of fine wool and earrings of\\nbrass.  When they see me coming they stand on the prows of their ships\\nand call to me, but I do not answer them.  I go to the little taverns\\nwhere the sailors lie all day long drinking black wine and playing with\\ndice and I sit down with them.\\n\\nI made the Prince my slave, and his slave who was a Tyrian I made my lord\\nfor the space of a moon.\\n\\nI put a figured ring on his finger and brought him to my house.  I have\\nwonderful things in my house.\\n\\nThe dust of the desert lies on your hair and your feet are scratched with\\nthorns and your body is scorched by the sun.  Come with me, Honorius, and\\nI will clothe you in a tunic of silk.  I will smear your body with myrrh\\nand pour spikenard on your hair.  I will clothe you in hyacinth and put\\nhoney in your mouth.  Love—\\n\\nHONORIUS.  There is no love but the love of God.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Who is He whose love is greater than that of mortal men?\\n\\nHONORIUS.  It is He whom thou seest on the cross, Myrrhina.  He is the\\nSon of God and was born of a virgin.  Three wise men who were kings\\nbrought Him offerings, and the shepherds who were lying on the hills were\\nwakened by a great light.\\n\\nThe Sibyls knew of His coming.  The groves and the oracles spake of Him.\\nDavid and the prophets announced Him.  There is no love like the love of\\nGod nor any love that can be compared to it.\\n\\nThe body is vile, Myrrhina.  God will raise thee up with a new body which\\nwill not know corruption, and thou shalt dwell in the Courts of the Lord\\nand see Him whose hair is like fine wool and whose feet are of brass.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  The beauty . . .\\n\\nHONORIUS.  The beauty of the soul increases until it can see God.\\nTherefore, Myrrhina, repent of thy sins.  The robber who was crucified\\nbeside Him He brought into Paradise.\\n\\n                                                                  [_Exit_.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  How strangely he spake to me.  And with what scorn did he\\nregard me.  I wonder why he spake to me so strangely.\\n\\n                                . . . . .\\n\\nHONORIUS.  Myrrhina, the scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now\\nclearly what I did not see before.  Take me to Alexandria and let me\\ntaste of the seven sins.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Do not mock me, Honorius, nor speak to me with such bitter\\nwords.  For I have repented of my sins and I am seeking a cavern in this\\ndesert where I too may dwell so that my soul may become worthy to see\\nGod.\\n\\nHONORIUS.  The sun is setting, Myrrhina.  Come with me to Alexandria.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  I will not go to Alexandria.\\n\\nHONORIUS.  Farewell, Myrrhina.\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  Honorius, farewell.  No, no, do not go.\\n\\n                                . . . . .\\n\\nI have cursed my beauty for what it has done, and cursed the wonder of my\\nbody for the evil that it has brought upon you.\\n\\nLord, this man brought me to Thy feet.  He told me of Thy coming upon\\nearth, and of the wonder of Thy birth, and the great wonder of Thy death\\nalso.  By him, O Lord, Thou wast revealed to me.\\n\\nHONORIUS.  You talk as a child, Myrrhina, and without knowledge.  Loosen\\nyour hands.  Why didst thou come to this valley in thy beauty?\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  The God whom thou worshippest led me here that I might repent\\nof my iniquities and know Him as the Lord.\\n\\nHONORIUS.  Why didst thou tempt me with words?\\n\\nMYRRHINA.  That thou shouldst see Sin in its painted mask and look on\\nDeath in its robe of Shame.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA FLORENTINE TRAGEDY\\nWITH OPENING SCENE BY T.

Certain and sure, the sprig is Guido Bardi,\\n   A lovely lord, a lord whose blood is blue!\\n\\n   BIANCA.  But where did he receive you?\\n\\n   MARIA.  Where, but there\\n   In yonder palace, in a painted hall!—\\n   Painted with naked women on the walls,—\\n   Would make a common man or blush or smile\\n   But he seemed not to heed them, being a lord.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  But how know you ’tis not a chamberlayne,\\n   A lackey merely?\\n\\n   MARIA.  Why, how know I there is a God in heaven?\\n   Because the angels have a master surely.\\n   So to this lord they bowed, all others bowed,\\n   And swept the marble flags, doffing their caps,\\n   With the gay plumes.  Because he stiffly said,\\n   And seemed to see me as those folk are seen\\n   That will be never seen again by you,\\n   ‘Woman, your mistress then returns this purse\\n   Of forty thousand crowns, is it fifty thousand?\\n   Come name the sum will buy me grace of her.’\\n\\n   BIANCA.  What, were there forty thousand crowns therein?\\n\\n   MARIA.  I know it was all gold; heavy with gold.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  It must be he, none else could give so much.\\n\\n   MARIA.  ’Tis he, ’tis my lord Guido, Guido Bardi.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  What said you?\\n\\n   MARIA.  I, I said my mistress never\\n   Looked at the gold, never opened the purse,\\n   Never counted a coin.  But asked again\\n   What she had asked before, ‘How young you looked?\\n   How handsome your lordship looked?  What doublet\\n   Your majesty had on?  What chains, what hose\\n   Upon your revered legs?’  And curtseyed\\n   I, . . .\\n\\n   BIANCA.  What said he?\\n\\n   MARIA.  Curtseyed I, and he replied,\\n   ‘Has she a lover then beside that old\\n   Soured husband or is it him she loves, my God!\\n   Is it him?’\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Well?\\n\\n   MARIA.  Curtseyed I low and said\\n   ‘Not him, my lord, nor you, nor no man else.\\n   Thou art rich, my lord, and honoured, my lord, and she\\n   Though not so rich is honoured . . .’\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Fool, you fool,\\n   I never bid you say a word of that.\\n\\n   MARIA.  Nor did I say a word of that you said;\\n   I said, ‘She loves him not, my lord, nor loves\\n   Any man else.  Yet she might like to love,\\n   If she were loved by one who pleased her well;\\n   For she is weary of spinning long alone.\\n   She is not rich and yet she is not poor; but young\\n   She is, my lord, and you are young.\\n\\n                                                       [_Pauses smiling_.]\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Quick, quick!\\n\\n   MARIA.  There, there!  ’Twas but to show you how I smiled\\n   Saying the lord was young.  It took him too;\\n   For he said, ‘This will do!  If I should call\\n   To-night to pay respect unto your lovely—\\n   Our lovely mistress, tell her that I said,\\n   Our lovely mistress, shall I be received?’\\n   And I said, ‘Yes.’  ‘Then say I come and if\\n   All else is well let her throw down some favour\\n   When as I pass below.’  He should be there!\\n   Look from the balcony; he should be there!—\\n   And there he is, dost see?\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Some favour.  Yes.\\n   This ribbon weighted by this brooch will do.\\n   Maria, be you busy near within, but, till\\n   I call take care you enter not.  Go down\\n   And let the young lord in, for hark, he knocks.\\n\\n                                                           [_Exit_ MARIA.]\\n\\n   Great ladies might he choose from and yet he\\n   Is drawn . . . ah, there my fear is!

Ah if! he is a wandering bee,\\n   Mere gallant taster, who befools poor flowers . . .\\n\\n       [MARIA _opens the door for_ GUIDO BARDI, _and then withdraws_.]\\n\\n   My lord, I learn that we have something here,\\n   In this poor house, which thou dost wish to buy.\\n   My husband is from home, but my poor fate\\n   Has made me perfect in the price of velvets,\\n   Of silks and gay brocades.  I think you offered\\n   Some forty thousand crowns, or fifty thousand,\\n   For something we have here?  And it must be\\n   That wonder of the loom, which my Simone\\n   Has lately home; it is a Lucca damask,\\n   The web is silver over-wrought with roses.\\n   Since you did offer fifty thousand crowns\\n   It must be that.  Pray wait, for I will fetch it.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Nay, nay, thou gracious wonder of a loom\\n   More cunning far than those of Lucca, I\\n   Had in my thought no damask silver cloth\\n   By hunch-back weavers woven toilsomely,\\n   If such are priced at fifty thousand crowns\\n   It shames me, for I hoped to buy a fabric\\n   For which a hundred thousand then were little.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  A hundred thousand was it that you said?\\n   Nay, poor Simone for so great a sum\\n   Would sell you everything the house contains.\\n   The thought of such a sum doth daze the brains\\n   Of merchant folk who live such lives as ours.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Would he sell everything this house contains?\\n   And every one, would he sell every one?\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Oh, everything and every one, my lord,\\n   Unless it were himself; he values not\\n   A woman as a velvet, or a wife\\n   At half the price of silver-threaded woof.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Then I would strike a bargain with him straight,\\n\\n   BIANCA.  He is from home; may be will sleep from home;\\n   But I, my lord, can show you all we have;\\n   Can measure ells and sum their price, my lord.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  It is thyself, Bianca, I would buy.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  O, then, my lord, it must be with Simone\\n   You strike your bargain; for to sell myself\\n   Would be to do what I most truly loathe.\\n   Good-night, my lord; it is with deep regret\\n   I find myself unable to oblige\\n   Your lordship.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Nay, I pray thee let me stay\\n   And pardon me the sorry part I played,\\n   As though I were a chapman and intent\\n   To lower prices, cheapen honest wares.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  My lord, there is no reason you should stay.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Thou art my reason, peerless, perfect, thou,\\n   The reason I am here and my life’s goal,\\n   For I was born to love the fairest things . . .\\n\\n   BIANCA.  To buy the fairest things that can be bought.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Cruel Bianca!  Cover me with scorn,\\n   I answer born to love thy priceless self,\\n   That never to a market could be brought,\\n   No more than winged souls that sail and soar\\n   Among the planets or about the moon.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  It is so much thy habit to buy love,\\n   Or that which is for sale and labelled love,\\n   Hardly couldst thou conceive a priceless love.\\n   But though my love has never been for sale\\n   I have been in a market bought and sold.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  This is some riddle which thy sweet wit reads\\n   To baffle mine and mock me yet again.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  My marriage, sir, I speak of marriage now,\\n   That common market where my husband went\\n   And prides himself he made a bargain then.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  The wretched chapman, how I hate his soul.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  He was a better bidder than thyself,\\n   And knew with whom to deal . . . he did not speak\\n   Of gold to me, but in my father’s ear\\n   He made it clink: to me he spoke of love,\\n   Honest and free and open without price.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  O white Bianca, lovely as the moon,\\n   The light of thy pure soul and shining wit\\n   Shows me my shame, and makes the thing I was\\n   Slink like a shadow from the thing I am.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Let that which casts the shadow act, my lord,\\n   And waste no thought on what its shadow does\\n   Or has done.  Are youth, and strength, and love\\n   Balked by mere shadows, so that they forget\\n   Themselves so far they cannot be recalled?\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Nobility is here, not in the court.\\n   There are the tinsel stars, here is the moon,\\n   Whose tranquil splendour makes a day of night.\\n   I have been starved by ladies, specks of light,\\n   And glory drowns me now I see the moon.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  I have refused round sums of solid gold\\n   And shall not be by tinsel phrases bought.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Dispute no more, witty, divine Bianca;\\n   Dispute no more.  See I have brought my lute!\\n   Close lock the door.  We will sup with the moon\\n   Like Persian princes, that, in Babylon\\n   Sup in the hanging gardens of the king.\\n   I know an air that can suspend the soul\\n   As high in heaven as those towered-gardens hang.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  My husband may return, we are not safe.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Didst thou not say that he would sleep from home?\\n\\n   BIANCA.  He was not sure, he said it might be so.\\n   He was not sure—and he would send my aunt\\n   To sleep with me, if he did so decide,\\n   And she has not yet come.\\n\\n   GUIDO [_starting_] Hark, what’s that?\\n\\n [_They listen_, _the sound of_ MARIA’S _voice in anger with some one is\\n                             faintly heard_.]\\n\\n   BIANCA.  It is Maria scolds some gossip crone.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  I thought the other voice had been a man’s.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  All still again, old crones are often gruff.\\n   You should be gone, my lord.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  O, sweet Bianca!\\n   How can I leave thee now!  Thy beauty made\\n   Two captives of my eyes, and they were mad\\n   To feast them on thy form, but now thy wit,\\n   The liberated perfume of a bud,\\n   Which while a bud seemed perfect, but now is\\n   That which can make its former self forgot:\\n   How can I leave the flower who loved the leaf?\\n   Till now I was the richest prince in Florence,\\n   I am a lover now would shun its throngs,\\n   And put away all state and seek retreat\\n   At Bellosguardo or Fiesole,\\n   Where roses in their fin’st profusion hide\\n   Some marble villa whose cool walls have rung\\n   A laughing echo to Decameron,\\n   And where thy laughter shall as gaily sound.\\n   Say thou canst love or with a silent kiss\\n   Instil that balmy knowledge on my soul.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Canst tell me what love is?\\n\\n   GUIDO.  It is consent,\\n   The union of two minds, two souls, two hearts,\\n   In all they think and hope and feel.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Such lovers might as well be dumb, for those\\n   Who think and hope and feel alike can never\\n   Have anything for one another’s ear.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Love is?  Love is the meeting of two worlds\\n   In never-ending change and counter-change.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Thus will my husband praise the mercer’s mart,\\n   Where the two worlds of East and West exchange.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Come.  Love is love, a kiss, a close embrace.\\n   It is . . .\\n\\n   BIANCA.  My husband calls that love\\n   When he hath slammed his weekly ledger to.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  I find my wit no better match for thine\\n   Than thou art match for an old crabbed man;\\n   But I am sure my youth and strength and blood\\n   Keep better tune with beauty gay and bright\\n   As thine is, than lean age and miser toil.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Well said, well said, I think he would not dare\\n   To face thee, more than owls dare face the sun;\\n   He’s the bent shadow such a form as thine\\n   Might cast upon a dung heap by the road,\\n   Though should it fall upon a proper floor\\n   Twould be at once a better man than he.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Your merchant living in the dread of loss\\n   Becomes perforce a coward, eats his heart.\\n   Dull souls they are, who, like caged prisoners watch\\n   And envy others’ joy; they taste no food\\n   But what its cost is present to their thought.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  I am my father’s daughter, in his eyes\\n   A home-bred girl who has been taught to spin.\\n   He never seems to think I have a face\\n   Which makes you gallants turn where’er I pass.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Thy night is darker than I dreamed, bright Star.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  He waits, stands by, and mutters to himself,\\n   And never enters with a frank address\\n   To any company.  His eyes meet mine\\n   And with a shudder I am sure he counts\\n   The cost of what I wear.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Forget him quite.\\n   Come, come, escape from out this dismal life,\\n   As a bright butterfly breaks spider’s web,\\n   And nest with me among those rosy bowers,\\n   Where we will love, as though the lives we led\\n   Till yesterday were ghoulish dreams dispersed\\n   By the great dawn of limpid joyous life.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Will I not come?\\n\\n   GUIDO.  O, make no question, come.\\n   They waste their time who ponder o’er bad dreams.\\n   We will away to hills, red roses clothe,\\n   And though the persons who did haunt that dream\\n   Live on, they shall by distance dwindled, seem\\n   No bigger than the smallest ear of corn\\n   That cowers at the passing of a bird,\\n   And silent shall they seem, out of ear-shot,\\n   Those voices that could jar, while we gaze back\\n   From rosy caves upon the hill-brow open,\\n   And ask ourselves if what we see is not\\n   A picture merely,—if dusty, dingy lives\\n   Continue there to choke themselves with malice.\\n   Wilt thou not come, Bianca?  Wilt thou not?\\n\\n                                                 [_A sound on the stair_.]\\n\\n   GUIDO.  What’s that?\\n\\n [_The door opens_, _they separate guiltily_, _and the husband enters_.]\\n\\n   SIMONE.  My good wife, you come slowly; were it not better\\n   To run to meet your lord?  Here, take my cloak.\\n   Take this pack first.  ’Tis heavy.  I have sold nothing:\\n   Save a furred robe unto the Cardinal’s son,\\n   Who hopes to wear it when his father dies,\\n   And hopes that will be soon.\\n\\n   But who is this?\\n   Why you have here some friend.  Some kinsman doubtless,\\n   Newly returned from foreign lands and fallen\\n   Upon a house without a host to greet him?\\n   I crave your pardon, kinsman.  For a house\\n   Lacking a host is but an empty thing\\n   And void of honour; a cup without its wine,\\n   A scabbard without steel to keep it straight,\\n   A flowerless garden widowed of the sun.\\n   Again I crave your pardon, my sweet cousin.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  This is no kinsman and no cousin neither.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  No kinsman, and no cousin!  You amaze me.\\n   Who is it then who with such courtly grace\\n   Deigns to accept our hospitalities?\\n\\n   GUIDO.  My name is Guido Bardi.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  What!  The son\\n   Of that great Lord of Florence whose dim towers\\n   Like shadows silvered by the wandering moon\\n   I see from out my casement every night!\\n   Sir Guido Bardi, you are welcome here,\\n   Twice welcome.  For I trust my honest wife,\\n   Most honest if uncomely to the eye,\\n   Hath not with foolish chatterings wearied you,\\n   As is the wont of women.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Your gracious lady,\\n   Whose beauty is a lamp that pales the stars\\n   And robs Diana’s quiver of her beams\\n   Has welcomed me with such sweet courtesies\\n   That if it be her pleasure, and your own,\\n   I will come often to your simple house.\\n   And when your business bids you walk abroad\\n   I will sit here and charm her loneliness\\n   Lest she might sorrow for you overmuch.\\n   What say you, good Simone?\\n\\n   SIMONE.  My noble Lord,\\n   You bring me such high honour that my tongue\\n   Like a slave’s tongue is tied, and cannot say\\n   The word it would.  Yet not to give you thanks\\n   Were to be too unmannerly.  So, I thank you,\\n   From my heart’s core.\\n\\n   It is such things as these\\n   That knit a state together, when a Prince\\n   So nobly born and of such fair address,\\n   Forgetting unjust Fortune’s differences,\\n   Comes to an honest burgher’s honest home\\n   As a most honest friend.\\n\\n   And yet, my Lord,\\n   I fear I am too bold.  Some other night\\n   We trust that you will come here as a friend;\\n   To-night you come to buy my merchandise.\\n   Is it not so?  Silks, velvets, what you will,\\n   I doubt not but I have some dainty wares\\n   Will woo your fancy.  True, the hour is late,\\n   But we poor merchants toil both night and day\\n   To make our scanty gains.  The tolls are high,\\n   And every city levies its own toll,\\n   And prentices are unskilful, and wives even\\n   Lack sense and cunning, though Bianca here\\n   Has brought me a rich customer to-night.\\n   Is it not so, Bianca?  But I waste time.\\n   Where is my pack?  Where is my pack, I say?\\n   Open it, my good wife.  Unloose the cords.\\n   Kneel down upon the floor.  You are better so.\\n   Nay not that one, the other.  Despatch, despatch!\\n   Buyers will grow impatient oftentimes.\\n   We dare not keep them waiting.  Ay! ’tis that,\\n   Give it to me; with care.  It is most costly.\\n   Touch it with care.  And now, my noble Lord—\\n   Nay, pardon, I have here a Lucca damask,\\n   The very web of silver and the roses\\n   So cunningly wrought that they lack perfume merely\\n   To cheat the wanton sense.  Touch it, my Lord.\\n   Is it not soft as water, strong as steel?\\n   And then the roses!  Are they not finely woven?\\n   I think the hillsides that best love the rose,\\n   At Bellosguardo or at Fiesole,\\n   Throw no such blossoms on the lap of spring,\\n   Or if they do their blossoms droop and die.\\n   Such is the fate of all the dainty things\\n   That dance in wind and water.  Nature herself\\n   Makes war on her own loveliness and slays\\n   Her children like Medea.  Nay but, my Lord,\\n   Look closer still.  Why in this damask here\\n   It is summer always, and no winter’s tooth\\n   Will ever blight these blossoms.  For every ell\\n   I paid a piece of gold.  Red gold, and good,\\n   The fruit of careful thrift.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Honest Simone,\\n   Enough, I pray you.  I am well content;\\n   To-morrow I will send my servant to you,\\n   Who will pay twice your price.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  My generous Prince!\\n   I kiss your hands.  And now I do remember\\n   Another treasure hidden in my house\\n   Which you must see.  It is a robe of state:\\n   Woven by a Venetian: the stuff, cut-velvet:\\n   The pattern, pomegranates: each separate seed\\n   Wrought of a pearl: the collar all of pearls,\\n   As thick as moths in summer streets at night,\\n   And whiter than the moons that madmen see\\n   Through prison bars at morning.  A male ruby\\n   Burns like a lighted coal within the clasp\\n   The Holy Father has not such a stone,\\n   Nor could the Indies show a brother to it.\\n   The brooch itself is of most curious art,\\n   Cellini never made a fairer thing\\n   To please the great Lorenzo.  You must wear it.\\n   There is none worthier in our city here,\\n   And it will suit you well.  Upon one side\\n   A slim and horned satyr leaps in gold\\n   To catch some nymph of silver.  Upon the other\\n   Stands Silence with a crystal in her hand,\\n   No bigger than the smallest ear of corn,\\n   That wavers at the passing of a bird,\\n   And yet so cunningly wrought that one would say,\\n   It breathed, or held its breath.\\n\\n   Worthy Bianca,\\n   Would not this noble and most costly robe\\n   Suit young Lord Guido well?\\n\\n   Nay, but entreat him;\\n   He will refuse you nothing, though the price\\n   Be as a prince’s ransom.  And your profit\\n   Shall not be less than mine.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Am I your prentice?\\n   Why should I chaffer for your velvet robe?\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Nay, fair Bianca, I will buy the robe,\\n   And all things that the honest merchant has\\n   I will buy also.  Princes must be ransomed,\\n   And fortunate are all high lords who fall\\n   Into the white hands of so fair a foe.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  I stand rebuked.  But you will buy my wares?\\n   Will you not buy them?  Fifty thousand crowns\\n   Would scarce repay me.  But you, my Lord, shall have them\\n   For forty thousand.  Is that price too high?\\n   Name your own price.  I have a curious fancy\\n   To see you in this wonder of the loom\\n   Amidst the noble ladies of the court,\\n   A flower among flowers.\\n\\n   They say, my lord,\\n   These highborn dames do so affect your Grace\\n   That where you go they throng like flies around you,\\n   Each seeking for your favour.\\n\\n   I have heard also\\n   Of husbands that wear horns, and wear them bravely,\\n   A fashion most fantastical.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Simone,\\n   Your reckless tongue needs curbing; and besides,\\n   You do forget this gracious lady here\\n   Whose delicate ears are surely not attuned\\n   To such coarse music.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  True: I had forgotten,\\n   Nor will offend again.  Yet, my sweet Lord,\\n   You’ll buy the robe of state.  Will you not buy it?\\n   But forty thousand crowns—’tis but a trifle,\\n   To one who is Giovanni Bardi’s heir.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Settle this thing to-morrow with my steward,\\n   Antonio Costa.  He will come to you.\\n   And you shall have a hundred thousand crowns\\n   If that will serve your purpose.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  A hundred thousand!\\n   Said you a hundred thousand?  Oh! be sure\\n   That will for all time and in everything\\n   Make me your debtor.  Ay! from this time forth\\n   My house, with everything my house contains\\n   Is yours, and only yours.\\n\\n   A hundred thousand!\\n   My brain is dazed.  I shall be richer far\\n   Than all the other merchants.  I will buy\\n   Vineyards and lands and gardens.  Every loom\\n   From Milan down to Sicily shall be mine,\\n   And mine the pearls that the Arabian seas\\n   Store in their silent caverns.\\n\\n   Generous Prince,\\n   This night shall prove the herald of my love,\\n   Which is so great that whatsoe’er you ask\\n   It will not be denied you.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  What if I asked\\n   For white Bianca here?\\n\\n   SIMONE.  You jest, my Lord;\\n   She is not worthy of so great a Prince.\\n   She is but made to keep the house and spin.\\n   Is it not so, good wife?  It is so.  Look!\\n   Your distaff waits for you.  Sit down and spin.\\n   Women should not be idle in their homes,\\n   For idle fingers make a thoughtless heart.\\n   Sit down, I say.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  What shall I spin?\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Oh! spin\\n   Some robe which, dyed in purple, sorrow might wear\\n   For her own comforting: or some long-fringed cloth\\n   In which a new-born and unwelcome babe\\n   Might wail unheeded; or a dainty sheet\\n   Which, delicately perfumed with sweet herbs,\\n   Might serve to wrap a dead man.  Spin what you will;\\n   I care not, I.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  The brittle thread is broken,\\n   The dull wheel wearies of its ceaseless round,\\n   The duller distaff sickens of its load;\\n   I will not spin to-night.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  It matters not.\\n   To-morrow you shall spin, and every day\\n   Shall find you at your distaff.  So Lucretia\\n   Was found by Tarquin.  So, perchance, Lucretia\\n   Waited for Tarquin.  Who knows?  I have heard\\n   Strange things about men’s wives.  And now, my lord,\\n   What news abroad?  I heard to-day at Pisa\\n   That certain of the English merchants there\\n   Would sell their woollens at a lower rate\\n   Than the just laws allow, and have entreated\\n   The Signory to hear them.\\n\\n   Is this well?\\n   Should merchant be to merchant as a wolf?\\n   And should the stranger living in our land\\n   Seek by enforced privilege or craft\\n   To rob us of our profits?\\n\\n   GUIDO.  What should I do\\n   With merchants or their profits?  Shall I go\\n   And wrangle with the Signory on your count?\\n   And wear the gown in which you buy from fools,\\n   Or sell to sillier bidders?  Honest Simone,\\n   Wool-selling or wool-gathering is for you.\\n   My wits have other quarries.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Noble Lord,\\n   I pray you pardon my good husband here,\\n   His soul stands ever in the market-place,\\n   And his heart beats but at the price of wool.\\n   Yet he is honest in his common way.\\n\\n                              [_To_ SIMONE]\\n\\n   And you, have you no shame?  A gracious Prince\\n   Comes to our house, and you must weary him\\n   With most misplaced assurance.  Ask his pardon.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  I ask it humbly.  We will talk to-night\\n   Of other things.  I hear the Holy Father\\n   Has sent a letter to the King of France\\n   Bidding him cross that shield of snow, the Alps,\\n   And make a peace in Italy, which will be\\n   Worse than a war of brothers, and more bloody\\n   Than civil rapine or intestine feuds.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Oh! we are weary of that King of France,\\n   Who never comes, but ever talks of coming.\\n   What are these things to me?  There are other things\\n   Closer, and of more import, good Simone.\\n\\n   BIANCA [_To Simone_].  I think you tire our most gracious guest.\\n   What is the King of France to us?  As much\\n   As are your English merchants with their wool.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Is it so then?  Is all this mighty world\\n   Narrowed into the confines of this room\\n   With but three souls for poor inhabitants?\\n   Ay! there are times when the great universe,\\n   Like cloth in some unskilful dyer’s vat,\\n   Shrivels into a handbreadth, and perchance\\n   That time is now!  Well! let that time be now.\\n   Let this mean room be as that mighty stage\\n   Whereon kings die, and our ignoble lives\\n   Become the stakes God plays for.\\n\\n   I do not know\\n   Why I speak thus.  My ride has wearied me.\\n   And my horse stumbled thrice, which is an omen\\n   That bodes not good to any.\\n\\n   Alas! my lord,\\n   How poor a bargain is this life of man,\\n   And in how mean a market are we sold!\\n   When we are born our mothers weep, but when\\n   We die there is none weeps for us.  No, not one.\\n\\n                       [_Passes to back of stage_.]\\n\\n   BIANCA.  How like a common chapman does he speak!\\n   I hate him, soul and body.  Cowardice\\n   Has set her pale seal on his brow.  His hands\\n   Whiter than poplar leaves in windy springs,\\n   Shake with some palsy; and his stammering mouth\\n   Blurts out a foolish froth of empty words\\n   Like water from a conduit.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Sweet Bianca,\\n   He is not worthy of your thought or mine.\\n   The man is but a very honest knave\\n   Full of fine phrases for life’s merchandise,\\n   Selling most dear what he must hold most cheap,\\n   A windy brawler in a world of words.\\n   I never met so eloquent a fool.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Oh, would that Death might take him where he stands!\\n\\n   SIMONE [_turning round_].  Who spake of Death?  Let no one speak of\\n   Death.\\n   What should Death do in such a merry house,\\n   With but a wife, a husband, and a friend\\n   To give it greeting?  Let Death go to houses\\n   Where there are vile, adulterous things, chaste wives\\n   Who growing weary of their noble lords\\n   Draw back the curtains of their marriage beds,\\n   And in polluted and dishonoured sheets\\n   Feed some unlawful lust.  Ay! ’tis so\\n   Strange, and yet so.  _You_ do not know the world.\\n   _You_ are too single and too honourable.\\n   I know it well.  And would it were not so,\\n   But wisdom comes with winters.  My hair grows grey,\\n   And youth has left my body.  Enough of that.\\n   To-night is ripe for pleasure, and indeed,\\n   I would be merry as beseems a host\\n   Who finds a gracious and unlooked-for guest\\n   Waiting to greet him.  [_Takes up a lute_.]\\n   But what is this, my lord?\\n   Why, you have brought a lute to play to us.\\n   Oh! play, sweet Prince.  And, if I am too bold,\\n   Pardon, but play.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  I will not play to-night.\\n   Some other night, Simone.\\n\\n   [_To_ BIANCA]  You and I\\n   Together, with no listeners but the stars,\\n   Or the more jealous moon.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Nay, but my lord!\\n   Nay, but I do beseech you.  For I have heard\\n   That by the simple fingering of a string,\\n   Or delicate breath breathed along hollowed reeds,\\n   Or blown into cold mouths of cunning bronze,\\n   Those who are curious in this art can draw\\n   Poor souls from prison-houses.  I have heard also\\n   How such strange magic lurks within these shells\\n   That at their bidding casements open wide\\n   And Innocence puts vine-leaves in her hair,\\n   And wantons like a mænad.  Let that pass.\\n   Your lute I know is chaste.  And therefore play:\\n   Ravish my ears with some sweet melody;\\n   My soul is in a prison-house, and needs\\n   Music to cure its madness.  Good Bianca,\\n   Entreat our guest to play.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Be not afraid,\\n   Our well-loved guest will choose his place and moment:\\n   That moment is not now.  You weary him\\n   With your uncouth insistence.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Honest Simone,\\n   Some other night.  To-night I am content\\n   With the low music of Bianca’s voice,\\n   Who, when she speaks, charms the too amorous air,\\n   And makes the reeling earth stand still, or fix\\n   His cycle round her beauty.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  You flatter her.\\n   She has her virtues as most women have,\\n   But beauty in a gem she may not wear.\\n   It is better so, perchance.\\n\\n   Well, my dear lord,\\n   If you will not draw melodies from your lute\\n   To charm my moody and o’er-troubled soul\\n   You’ll drink with me at least?\\n\\n                                   [_Motioning_ GUIDO _to his own place_.]\\n\\n   Your place is laid.\\n   Fetch me a stool, Bianca.  Close the shutters.\\n   Set the great bar across.  I would not have\\n   The curious world with its small prying eyes\\n   To peer upon our pleasure.\\n\\n   Now, my lord,\\n   Give us a toast from a full brimming cup.\\n\\n                                                          [_Starts back_.]\\n\\n   What is this stain upon the cloth?  It looks\\n   As purple as a wound upon Christ’s side.\\n   Wine merely is it?  I have heard it said\\n   When wine is spilt blood is spilt also,\\n   But that’s a foolish tale.\\n\\n   My lord, I trust\\n   My grape is to your liking?  The wine of Naples\\n   Is fiery like its mountains.  Our Tuscan vineyards\\n   Yield a more wholesome juice.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  I like it well,\\n   Honest Simone; and, with your good leave,\\n   Will toast the fair Bianca when her lips\\n   Have like red rose-leaves floated on this cup\\n   And left its vintage sweeter.  Taste, Bianca.\\n\\n                                                        [BIANCA _drinks_.]\\n\\n   Oh, all the honey of Hyblean bees,\\n   Matched with this draught were bitter!\\n   Good Simone,\\n   You do not share the feast.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  It is strange, my lord,\\n   I cannot eat or drink with you, to-night.\\n   Some humour, or some fever in my blood,\\n   At other seasons temperate, or some thought\\n   That like an adder creeps from point to point,\\n   That like a madman crawls from cell to cell,\\n   Poisons my palate and makes appetite\\n   A loathing, not a longing.\\n\\n                                                           [_Goes aside_.]\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Sweet Bianca,\\n   This common chapman wearies me with words.\\n   I must go hence.  To-morrow I will come.\\n   Tell me the hour.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Come with the youngest dawn!\\n   Until I see you all my life is vain.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Ah! loose the falling midnight of your hair,\\n   And in those stars, your eyes, let me behold\\n   Mine image, as in mirrors.  Dear Bianca,\\n   Though it be but a shadow, keep me there,\\n   Nor gaze at anything that does not show\\n   Some symbol of my semblance.  I am jealous\\n   Of what your vision feasts on.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  Oh! be sure\\n   Your image will be with me always.  Dear\\n   Love can translate the very meanest thing\\n   Into a sign of sweet remembrances.\\n   But come before the lark with its shrill song\\n   Has waked a world of dreamers.  I will stand\\n   Upon the balcony.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  And by a ladder\\n   Wrought out of scarlet silk and sewn with pearls\\n   Will come to meet me.  White foot after foot,\\n   Like snow upon a rose-tree.\\n\\n   BIANCA.  As you will.\\n   You know that I am yours for love or Death.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Simone, I must go to mine own house.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  So soon?  Why should you?  The great Duomo’s bell\\n   Has not yet tolled its midnight, and the watchmen\\n   Who with their hollow horns mock the pale moon,\\n   Lie drowsy in their towers.  Stay awhile.\\n   I fear we may not see you here again,\\n   And that fear saddens my too simple heart.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Be not afraid, Simone.  I will stand\\n   Most constant in my friendship, But to-night\\n   I go to mine own home, and that at once.\\n   To-morrow, sweet Bianca.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Well, well, so be it.\\n   I would have wished for fuller converse with you,\\n   My new friend, my honourable guest,\\n   But that it seems may not be.\\n\\n   And besides\\n   I do not doubt your father waits for you,\\n   Wearying for voice or footstep.  You, I think,\\n   Are his one child?  He has no other child.\\n   You are the gracious pillar of his house,\\n   The flower of a garden full of weeds.\\n   Your father’s nephews do not love him well\\n   So run folks’ tongues in Florence.  I meant but that.\\n   Men say they envy your inheritance\\n   And look upon your vineyards with fierce eyes\\n   As Ahab looked on Naboth’s goodly field.\\n   But that is but the chatter of a town\\n   Where women talk too much.\\n\\n   Good-night, my lord.\\n   Fetch a pine torch, Bianca.  The old staircase\\n   Is full of pitfalls, and the churlish moon\\n   Grows, like a miser, niggard of her beams,\\n   And hides her face behind a muslin mask\\n   As harlots do when they go forth to snare\\n   Some wretched soul in sin.  Now, I will get\\n   Your cloak and sword.  Nay, pardon, my good Lord,\\n   It is but meet that I should wait on you\\n   Who have so honoured my poor burgher’s house,\\n   Drunk of my wine, and broken bread, and made\\n   Yourself a sweet familiar.  Oftentimes\\n   My wife and I will talk of this fair night\\n   And its great issues.\\n\\n   Why, what a sword is this.\\n   Ferrara’s temper, pliant as a snake,\\n   And deadlier, I doubt not.  With such steel,\\n   One need fear nothing in the moil of life.\\n   I never touched so delicate a blade.\\n   I have a sword too, somewhat rusted now.\\n   We men of peace are taught humility,\\n   And to bear many burdens on our backs,\\n   And not to murmur at an unjust world,\\n   And to endure unjust indignities.\\n   We are taught that, and like the patient Jew\\n   Find profit in our pain.\\n\\n   Yet I remember\\n   How once upon the road to Padua\\n   A robber sought to take my pack-horse from me,\\n   I slit his throat and left him.  I can bear\\n   Dishonour, public insult, many shames,\\n   Shrill scorn, and open contumely, but he\\n   Who filches from me something that is mine,\\n   Ay! though it be the meanest trencher-plate\\n   From which I feed mine appetite—oh! he\\n   Perils his soul and body in the theft\\n   And dies for his small sin.  From what strange clay\\n   We men are moulded!\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Why do you speak like this?\\n\\n   SIMONE.  I wonder, my Lord Guido, if my sword\\n   Is better tempered than this steel of yours?\\n   Shall we make trial?  Or is my state too low\\n   For you to cross your rapier against mine,\\n   In jest, or earnest?\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Naught would please me better\\n   Than to stand fronting you with naked blade\\n   In jest, or earnest.  Give me mine own sword.\\n   Fetch yours.  To-night will settle the great issue\\n   Whether the Prince’s or the merchant’s steel\\n   Is better tempered.  Was not that your word?\\n   Fetch your own sword.  Why do you tarry, sir?\\n\\n   SIMONE.  My lord, of all the gracious courtesies\\n   That you have showered on my barren house\\n   This is the highest.\\n\\n   Bianca, fetch my sword.\\n   Thrust back that stool and table.  We must have\\n   An open circle for our match at arms,\\n   And good Bianca here shall hold the torch\\n   Lest what is but a jest grow serious.\\n\\n   BIANCA [_To Guido_].  Oh! kill him, kill him!\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Hold the torch, Bianca.\\n\\n                                                  [_They begin to fight_.]\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Have at you!  Ah!  Ha! would you?\\n\\n                                               [_He is wounded by_ GUIDO.]\\n\\n   A scratch, no more.  The torch was in mine eyes.\\n   Do not look sad, Bianca.  It is nothing.\\n   Your husband bleeds, ’tis nothing.  Take a cloth,\\n   Bind it about mine arm.  Nay, not so tight.\\n   More softly, my good wife.  And be not sad,\\n   I pray you be not sad.  No; take it off.\\n   What matter if I bleed?\\n\\n                                                    [_Tears bandage off_.]\\n\\n   Again! again!\\n\\n                         [SIMONE _disarms_ GUIDO]\\n\\n   My gentle Lord, you see that I was right\\n   My sword is better tempered, finer steel,\\n   But let us match our daggers.\\n\\n   BIANCA [_to_ GUIDO]\\n   Kill him! kill him!\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Put out the torch, Bianca.\\n\\n                                                [BIANCA _puts out torch_.]\\n\\n   Now, my good Lord,\\n   Now to the death of one, or both of us,\\n   Or all three it may be.  [_They fight_.]\\n\\n   There and there.\\n   Ah, devil! do I hold thee in my grip?\\n\\n       [SIMONE _overpowers Guido and throws him down over table_.]\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Fool! take your strangling fingers from my throat.\\n   I am my father’s only son; the State\\n   Has but one heir, and that false enemy France\\n   Waits for the ending of my father’s line\\n   To fall upon our city.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Hush! your father\\n   When he is childless will be happier.\\n   As for the State, I think our state of Florence\\n   Needs no adulterous pilot at its helm.\\n   Your life would soil its lilies.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Take off your hands\\n   Take off your damned hands.  Loose me, I say!\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Nay, you are caught in such a cunning vice\\n   That nothing will avail you, and your life\\n   Narrowed into a single point of shame\\n   Ends with that shame and ends most shamefully.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Oh! let me have a priest before I die!\\n\\n   SIMONE.  What wouldst thou have a priest for?  Tell thy sins\\n   To God, whom thou shalt see this very night\\n   And then no more for ever.  Tell thy sins\\n   To Him who is most just, being pitiless,\\n   Most pitiful being just.  As for myself. . .\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Oh! help me, sweet Bianca! help me, Bianca,\\n   Thou knowest I am innocent of harm.\\n\\n   SIMONE.  What, is there life yet in those lying lips?\\n   Die like a dog with lolling tongue!  Die!  Die!\\n   And the dumb river shall receive your corse\\n   And wash it all unheeded to the sea.\\n\\n   GUIDO.  Lord Christ receive my wretched soul to-night!\\n\\n   SIMONE.  Amen to that.

To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.

[_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_.]\\n   Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of Santa\\n   Croce?  [_Citizen bows_.]  I thank you, sir.\\n\\nASCANIO\\n\\n   Well?\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   Ay! it is here.\\n\\nASCANIO\\n\\n   I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   [_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]  ‘The hour noon;\\n   the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s\\n   Day.’\\n\\nASCANIO\\n\\n   And what of the man, how shall we know him?\\n\\nGUIDO [_reading still_]\\n\\n   ‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the\\n   shoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.\\n\\nASCANIO\\n\\n   I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of\\n   your father?\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,\\n   just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a\\n   man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,\\n   signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would\\n   know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the\\n   writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me\\n   that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by\\n   some one he had never since seen.\\n\\nASCANIO\\n\\n   And you don’t know who your father is?\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   No.\\n\\nASCANIO\\n\\n   No recollection of him even?\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   None, Ascanio, none.\\n\\nASCANIO [_laughing_]\\n\\n   Then he could never have boxed your ears so often as my father did\\n   mine.\\n\\nGUIDO [_smiling_]\\n\\n   I am sure you never deserved it.\\n\\nASCANIO\\n\\n   Never; and that made it worse.  I hadn’t the consciousness of guilt to\\n   buoy me up.  What hour did you say he fixed?\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   Noon.\\n\\n                                       [_Clock in the Cathedral strikes_.]\\n\\nASCANIO\\n\\n   It is that now, and your man has not come.  I don’t believe in him,\\n   Guido.  I think it is some wench who has set her eye at you; and, as I\\n   have followed you from Perugia to Padua, I swear you shall follow me\\n   to the nearest tavern.  [_Rises_.]  By the great gods of eating,\\n   Guido, I am as hungry as a widow is for a husband, as tired as a young\\n   maid is of good advice, and as dry as a monk’s sermon.  Come, Guido,\\n   you stand there looking at nothing, like the fool who tried to look\\n   into his own mind; your man will not come.\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   Well, I suppose you are right.  Ah!  [_Just as he is leaving the stage\\n   with_ ASCANIO, _enter_ LORD MORANZONE _in a violet cloak_, _with a\\n   silver falcon broidered on the shoulder_; _he passes across to the\\n   Cathedral_, _and just as he is going in_ GUIDO _runs up and touches\\n   him_.]\\n\\nMORANZONE\\n\\n   Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   What!

[_Sits down on a stone seat_.]\\n   Stood he tall?\\n   I warrant he looked tall upon his horse.\\n   His hair was black? or perhaps a reddish gold,\\n   Like a red fire of gold?  Was his voice low?\\n   The very bravest men have voices sometimes\\n   Full of low music; or a clarion was it\\n   That brake with terror all his enemies?\\n   Did he ride singly? or with many squires\\n   And valiant gentlemen to serve his state?\\n   For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins\\n   Beat with the blood of kings.  Was he a king?\\n\\nMORANZONE\\n\\n   Ay, of all men he was the kingliest.\\n\\nGUIDO [_proudly_]\\n\\n   Then when you saw my noble father last\\n   He was set high above the heads of men?\\n\\nMORANZONE\\n\\n   Ay, he was high above the heads of men,\\n\\n[_Walks over to_ GUIDO _and puts his hand upon his shoulder_.]\\n\\n   On a red scaffold, with a butcher’s block\\n   Set for his neck.\\n\\nGUIDO [_leaping up_]\\n\\n   What dreadful man art thou,\\n   That like a raven, or the midnight owl,\\n   Com’st with this awful message from the grave?\\n\\nMORANZONE\\n\\n   I am known here as the Count Moranzone,\\n   Lord of a barren castle on a rock,\\n   With a few acres of unkindly land\\n   And six not thrifty servants.  But I was one\\n   Of Parma’s noblest princes; more than that,\\n   I was your father’s friend.\\n\\nGUIDO [_clasping his hand_]\\n\\n   Tell me of him.\\n\\nMORANZONE\\n\\n   You are the son of that great Duke Lorenzo,\\n   He was the Prince of Parma, and the Duke\\n   Of all the fair domains of Lombardy\\n   Down to the gates of Florence; nay, Florence even\\n   Was wont to pay him tribute—\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   Come to his death.\\n\\nMORANZONE\\n\\n   You will hear that soon enough.  Being at war—\\n   O noble lion of war, that would not suffer\\n   Injustice done in Italy!—he led\\n   The very flower of chivalry against\\n   That foul adulterous Lord of Rimini,\\n   Giovanni Malatesta—whom God curse!\\n   And was by him in treacherous ambush taken,\\n   And like a villain, or a low-born knave,\\n   Was by him on the public scaffold murdered.\\n\\nGUIDO [_clutching his dagger_]\\n\\n   Doth Malatesta live?\\n\\nMORANZONE\\n\\n   No, he is dead.\\n\\nGUIDO\\n\\n   Did you say dead?

The\\npoems were first collected by their author when he was twenty-sex years\\nold, and though never, until recently, well received by the critics, have\\nsurvived the test of NINE editions.  Readers will be able to make for\\nthemselves the obvious and striking contrasts between these first and\\nlast phases of Oscar Wilde’s literary activity.  The intervening period\\nwas devoted almost entirely to dramas, prose, fiction, essays, and\\ncriticism.\\n\\n                                                               ROBERT ROSS\\n\\nREFORM CLUB,\\n      _April_ 5, 1911.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\n                                                                  PAGE\\nPREFACE                                                              v\\nTHE BALLAD OF READING GAOL (_Complete Version_)                      1\\nTHE BALLAD OF READING GAOL (_Shorter Version_)                      61\\nAVE IMPERATRIX                                                      89\\nTO MY WIFE (WITH A COPY OF MY POEMS)                               100\\nMAGDALEN WALKS                                                     102\\nTHEOCRITUS—A VILLANELLE                                            106\\nSONNETS—\\n                  GREECE                                           108\\n                  PORTIA (TO ELLEN TERRY)                          110\\n                  FABIEN DEI FRANCHI (TO HENRY IRVING)             112\\n                  PHÈDRE (TO SARAH BERNHARDT)                      114\\n                  ON HEARING THE DIES IRÆ SUNG IN THE              116\\n                  SISTINE CHAPEL\\n                  AVE MARIA GRATIA PLENA                           118\\n                  LIBERTATIS SACRA FAMES                           120\\n                  ROSES AND RUE                                    122\\n                  FROM ‘THE GARDEN OF EROS’                        128\\n                  THE HARLOT’S HOUSE                               140\\n                  FROM ‘THE BURDEN OF ITYS’                        144\\n                  FLOWER OF LOVE                                   158\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\n\\nAT the end of the complete text will be found a shorter version based on\\nthe original draft of the poem.

did not wear his scarlet coat,\\n      For blood and wine are red,\\n   And blood and wine were on his hands\\n      When they found him with the dead,\\n   The poor dead woman whom he loved,\\n      And murdered in her bed.\\n\\n   He walked amongst the Trial Men\\n      In a suit of shabby grey;\\n   A cricket cap was on his head,\\n      And his step seemed light and gay;\\n   But I never saw a man who looked\\n      So wistfully at the day.\\n\\n   I never saw a man who looked\\n      With such a wistful eye\\n   Upon that little tent of blue\\n      Which prisoners call the sky,\\n   And at every drifting cloud that went\\n      With sails of silver by.\\n\\n   I walked, with other souls in pain,\\n      Within another ring,\\n   And was wondering if the man had done\\n      A great or little thing,\\n   When a voice behind me whispered low,\\n      ‘_That fellow’s got to swing_.’\\n\\n   Dear Christ! the very prison walls\\n      Suddenly seemed to reel,\\n   And the sky above my head became\\n      Like a casque of scorching steel;\\n   And, though I was a soul in pain,\\n      My pain I could not feel.\\n\\n   I only knew what hunted thought\\n      Quickened his step, and why\\n   He looked upon the garish day\\n      With such a wistful eye;\\n   The man had killed the thing he loved,\\n      And so he had to die.\\n\\n   Yet each man kills the thing he loves,\\n      By each let this be heard,\\n   Some do it with a bitter look,\\n      Some with a flattering word,\\n   The coward does it with a kiss,\\n      The brave man with a sword!\\n\\n   Some kill their love when they are young,\\n      And some when they are old;\\n   Some strangle with the hands of Lust,\\n      Some with the hands of Gold:\\n   The kindest use a knife, because\\n      The dead so soon grow cold.\\n\\n   Some love too little, some too long,\\n      Some sell, and others buy;\\n   Some do the deed with many tears,\\n      And some without a sigh:\\n   For each man kills the thing he loves,\\n      Yet each man does not die.\\n\\n   He does not die a death of shame\\n      On a day of dark disgrace,\\n   Nor have a noose about his neck,\\n      Nor a cloth upon his face,\\n   Nor drop feet foremost through the floor\\n      Into an empty space.\\n\\n   He does not sit with silent men\\n      Who watch him night and day;\\n   Who watch him when he tries to weep,\\n      And when he tries to pray;\\n   Who watch him lest himself should rob\\n      The prison of its prey.\\n\\n   He does not wake at dawn to see\\n      Dread figures throng his room,\\n   The shivering Chaplain robed in white,\\n      The Sheriff stern with gloom,\\n   And the Governor all in shiny black,\\n      With the yellow face of Doom.\\n\\n   He does not rise in piteous haste\\n      To put on convict-clothes,\\n   While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes\\n      Each new and nerve-twitched pose,\\n   Fingering a watch whose little ticks\\n      Are like horrible hammer-blows.\\n\\n   He does not know that sickening thirst\\n      That sands one’s throat, before\\n   The hangman with his gardener’s gloves\\n      Slips through the padded door,\\n   And binds one with three leathern thongs,\\n      That the throat may thirst no more.\\n\\n   He does not bend his head to hear\\n      The Burial Office read,\\n   Nor, while the terror of his soul\\n      Tells him he is not dead,\\n   Cross his own coffin, as he moves\\n      Into the hideous shed.\\n\\n   He does not stare upon the air\\n      Through a little roof of glass:\\n   He does not pray with lips of clay\\n      For his agony to pass;\\n   Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek\\n      The kiss of Caiaphas.\\n\\n                                    II\\n\\n   SIX weeks our guardsman walked the yard,\\n      In the suit of shabby grey:\\n   His cricket cap was on his head,\\n      And his step seemed light and gay,\\n   But I never saw a man who looked\\n      So wistfully at the day.\\n\\n   I never saw a man who looked\\n      With such a wistful eye\\n   Upon that little tent of blue\\n      Which prisoners call the sky,\\n   And at every wandering cloud that trailed\\n      Its ravelled fleeces by.\\n\\n   He did not wring his hands, as do\\n      Those witless men who dare\\n   To try to rear the changeling Hope\\n      In the cave of black Despair:\\n   He only looked upon the sun,\\n      And drank the morning air.\\n\\n   He did not wring his hands nor weep,\\n      Nor did he peek or pine,\\n   But he drank the air as though it held\\n      Some healthful anodyne;\\n   With open mouth he drank the sun\\n      As though it had been wine!\\n\\n   And I and all the souls in pain,\\n      Who tramped the other ring,\\n   Forgot if we ourselves had done\\n      A great or little thing,\\n   And watched with gaze of dull amaze\\n      The man who had to swing.\\n\\n   And strange it was to see him pass\\n      With a step so light and gay,\\n   And strange it was to see him look\\n      So wistfully at the day,\\n   And strange it was to think that he\\n      Had such a debt to pay.\\n\\n   For oak and elm have pleasant leaves\\n      That in the springtime shoot:\\n   But grim to see is the gallows-tree,\\n      With its adder-bitten root,\\n   And, green or dry, a man must die\\n      Before it bears its fruit!\\n\\n   The loftiest place is that seat of grace\\n      For which all worldlings try:\\n   But who would stand in hempen band\\n      Upon a scaffold high,\\n   And through a murderer’s collar take\\n      His last look at the sky?\\n\\n   It is sweet to dance to violins\\n      When Love and Life are fair:\\n   To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\\n      Is delicate and rare:\\n   But it is not sweet with nimble feet\\n      To dance upon the air!\\n\\n   So with curious eyes and sick surmise\\n      We watched him day by day,\\n   And wondered if each one of us\\n      Would end the self-same way,\\n   For none can tell to what red Hell\\n      His sightless soul may stray.\\n\\n   At last the dead man walked no more\\n      Amongst the Trial Men,\\n   And I knew that he was standing up\\n      In the black dock’s dreadful pen,\\n   And that never would I see his face\\n      In God’s sweet world again.\\n\\n   Like two doomed ships that pass in storm\\n      We had crossed each other’s way:\\n   But we made no sign, we said no word,\\n      We had no word to say;\\n   For we did not meet in the holy night,\\n      But in the shameful day.\\n\\n   A prison wall was round us both,\\n      Two outcast men we were:\\n   The world had thrust us from its heart,\\n      And God from out His care:\\n   And the iron gin that waits for Sin\\n      Had caught us in its snare.\\n\\n                                   III\\n\\n   IN Debtors’ Yard the stones are hard,\\n      And the dripping wall is high,\\n   So it was there he took the air\\n      Beneath the leaden sky,\\n   And by each side a Warder walked,\\n      For fear the man might die.\\n\\n   Or else he sat with those who watched\\n      His anguish night and day;\\n   Who watched him when he rose to weep,\\n      And when he crouched to pray;\\n   Who watched him lest himself should rob\\n      Their scaffold of its prey.\\n\\n   The Governor was strong upon\\n      The Regulations Act:\\n   The Doctor said that Death was but\\n      A scientific fact:\\n   And twice a day the Chaplain called,\\n      And left a little tract.\\n\\n   And twice a day he smoked his pipe,\\n      And drank his quart of beer:\\n   His soul was resolute, and held\\n      No hiding-place for fear;\\n   He often said that he was glad\\n      The hangman’s hands were near.\\n\\n   But why he said so strange a thing\\n      No Warder dared to ask:\\n   For he to whom a watcher’s doom\\n      Is given as his task,\\n   Must set a lock upon his lips,\\n      And make his face a mask.\\n\\n   Or else he might be moved, and try\\n      To comfort or console:\\n   And what should Human Pity do\\n      Pent up in Murderers’ Hole?\\n   What word of grace in such a place\\n      Could help a brother’s soul?\\n\\n   With slouch and swing around the ring\\n      We trod the Fools’ Parade!\\n   We did not care: we knew we were\\n      The Devil’s Own Brigade:\\n   And shaven head and feet of lead\\n      Make a merry masquerade.\\n\\n   We tore the tarry rope to shreds\\n      With blunt and bleeding nails;\\n   We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\\n      And cleaned the shining rails:\\n   And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\\n      And clattered with the pails.\\n\\n   We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\\n      We turned the dusty drill:\\n   We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\\n      And sweated on the mill:\\n   But in the heart of every man\\n      Terror was lying still.\\n\\n   So still it lay that every day\\n      Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:\\n   And we forgot the bitter lot\\n      That waits for fool and knave,\\n   Till once, as we tramped in from work,\\n      We passed an open grave.\\n\\n   With yawning mouth the yellow hole\\n      Gaped for a living thing;\\n   The very mud cried out for blood\\n      To the thirsty asphalte ring:\\n   And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\\n      Some prisoner had to swing.\\n\\n   Right in we went, with soul intent\\n      On Death and Dread and Doom:\\n   The hangman, with his little bag,\\n      Went shuffling through the gloom:\\n   And each man trembled as he crept\\n      Into his numbered tomb.\\n\\n   That night the empty corridors\\n      Were full of forms of Fear,\\n   And up and down the iron town\\n      Stole feet we could not hear,\\n   And through the bars that hide the stars\\n      White faces seemed to peer.\\n\\n   He lay as one who lies and dreams\\n      In a pleasant meadow-land,\\n   The watchers watched him as he slept,\\n      And could not understand\\n   How one could sleep so sweet a sleep\\n      With a hangman close at hand.\\n\\n   But there is no sleep when men must weep\\n      Who never yet have wept:\\n   So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—\\n      That endless vigil kept,\\n   And through each brain on hands of pain\\n      Another’s terror crept.\\n\\n   Alas! it is a fearful thing\\n      To feel another’s guilt!\\n   For, right within, the sword of Sin\\n      Pierced to its poisoned hilt,\\n   And as molten lead were the tears we shed\\n      For the blood we had not spilt.\\n\\n   The Warders with their shoes of felt\\n      Crept by each padlocked door,\\n   And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\\n      Grey figures on the floor,\\n   And wondered why men knelt to pray\\n      Who never prayed before.\\n\\n   All through the night we knelt and prayed,\\n      Mad mourners of a corse!\\n   The troubled plumes of midnight were\\n      The plumes upon a hearse:\\n   And bitter wine upon a sponge\\n      Was the savour of Remorse.\\n\\n   The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,\\n      But never came the day:\\n   And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,\\n      In the corners where we lay:\\n   And each evil sprite that walks by night\\n      Before us seemed to play.\\n\\n   They glided past, they glided fast,\\n      Like travellers through a mist:\\n   They mocked the moon in a rigadoon\\n      Of delicate turn and twist,\\n   And with formal pace and loathsome grace\\n      The phantoms kept their tryst.\\n\\n   With mop and mow, we saw them go,\\n      Slim shadows hand in hand:\\n   About, about, in ghostly rout\\n      They trod a saraband:\\n   And the damned grotesques made arabesques,\\n      Like the wind upon the sand!\\n\\n   With the pirouettes of marionettes,\\n      They tripped on pointed tread:\\n   But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\\n      As their grisly masque they led,\\n   And loud they sang, and long they sang,\\n      For they sang to wake the dead.\\n\\n   ‘Oho!’ they cried, ‘The world is wide,\\n      But fettered limbs go lame!\\n   And once, or twice, to throw the dice\\n      Is a gentlemanly game,\\n   But he does not win who plays with Sin\\n      In the secret House of Shame.’\\n\\n   No things of air these antics were,\\n      That frolicked with such glee:\\n   To men whose lives were held in gyves,\\n      And whose feet might not go free,\\n   Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\\n      Most terrible to see.\\n\\n   Around, around, they waltzed and wound;\\n      Some wheeled in smirking pairs;\\n   With the mincing step of a demirep\\n      Some sidled up the stairs:\\n   And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\\n      Each helped us at our prayers.\\n\\n   The morning wind began to moan,\\n      But still the night went on:\\n   Through its giant loom the web of gloom\\n      Crept till each thread was spun:\\n   And, as we prayed, we grew afraid\\n      Of the Justice of the Sun.\\n\\n   The moaning wind went wandering round\\n      The weeping prison-wall:\\n   Till like a wheel of turning steel\\n      We felt the minutes crawl:\\n   O moaning wind! what had we done\\n      To have such a seneschal?\\n\\n   At last I saw the shadowed bars,\\n      Like a lattice wrought in lead,\\n   Move right across the whitewashed wall\\n      That faced my three-plank bed,\\n   And I knew that somewhere in the world\\n      God’s dreadful dawn was red.\\n\\n   At six o’clock we cleaned our cells,\\n      At seven all was still,\\n   But the sough and swing of a mighty wing\\n      The prison seemed to fill,\\n   For the Lord of Death with icy breath\\n      Had entered in to kill.\\n\\n   He did not pass in purple pomp,\\n      Nor ride a moon-white steed.\\n   Three yards of cord and a sliding board\\n      Are all the gallows’ need:\\n   So with rope of shame the Herald came\\n      To do the secret deed.\\n\\n   We were as men who through a fen\\n      Of filthy darkness grope:\\n   We did not dare to breathe a prayer,\\n      Or to give our anguish scope:\\n   Something was dead in each of us,\\n      And what was dead was Hope.\\n\\n   For Man’s grim Justice goes its way,\\n      And will not swerve aside:\\n   It slays the weak, it slays the strong,\\n      It has a deadly stride:\\n   With iron heel it slays the strong,\\n      The monstrous parricide!\\n\\n   We waited for the stroke of eight:\\n      Each tongue was thick with thirst:\\n   For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\\n      That makes a man accursed,\\n   And Fate will use a running noose\\n      For the best man and the worst.\\n\\n   We had no other thing to do,\\n      Save to wait for the sign to come:\\n   So, like things of stone in a valley lone,\\n      Quiet we sat and dumb:\\n   But each man’s heart beat thick and quick,\\n      Like a madman on a drum!\\n\\n   With sudden shock the prison-clock\\n      Smote on the shivering air,\\n   And from all the gaol rose up a wail\\n      Of impotent despair,\\n   Like the sound that frightened marshes hear\\n      From some leper in his lair.\\n\\n   And as one sees most fearful things\\n      In the crystal of a dream,\\n   We saw the greasy hempen rope\\n      Hooked to the blackened beam,\\n   And heard the prayer the hangman’s snare\\n      Strangled into a scream.\\n\\n   And all the woe that moved him so\\n      That he gave that bitter cry,\\n   And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\\n      None knew so well as I:\\n   For he who lives more lives than one\\n      More deaths than one must die.\\n\\n                                    IV\\n\\n   THERE is no chapel on the day\\n      On which they hang a man:\\n   The Chaplain’s heart is far too sick,\\n      Or his face is far too wan,\\n   Or there is that written in his eyes\\n      Which none should look upon.\\n\\n   So they kept us close till nigh on noon,\\n      And then they rang the bell,\\n   And the Warders with their jingling keys\\n      Opened each listening cell,\\n   And down the iron stair we tramped,\\n      Each from his separate Hell.\\n\\n   Out into God’s sweet air we went,\\n      But not in wonted way,\\n   For this man’s face was white with fear,\\n      And that man’s face was grey,\\n   And I never saw sad men who looked\\n      So wistfully at the day.\\n\\n   I never saw sad men who looked\\n      With such a wistful eye\\n   Upon that little tent of blue\\n      We prisoners called the sky,\\n   And at every careless cloud that passed\\n      In happy freedom by.\\n\\n   But there were those amongst us all\\n      Who walked with downcast head,\\n   And knew that, had each got his due,\\n      They should have died instead:\\n   He had but killed a thing that lived,\\n      Whilst they had killed the dead.\\n\\n   For he who sins a second time\\n      Wakes a dead soul to pain,\\n   And draws it from its spotted shroud,\\n      And makes it bleed again,\\n   And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,\\n      And makes it bleed in vain!\\n\\n   Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb\\n      With crooked arrows starred,\\n   Silently we went round and round\\n      The slippery asphalte yard;\\n   Silently we went round and round,\\n      And no man spoke a word.\\n\\n   Silently we went round and round,\\n      And through each hollow mind\\n   The Memory of dreadful things\\n      Rushed like a dreadful wind,\\n   And Horror stalked before each man,\\n      And Terror crept behind.\\n\\n   The Warders strutted up and down,\\n      And kept their herd of brutes,\\n   Their uniforms were spick and span,\\n      And they wore their Sunday suits,\\n   But we knew the work they had been at,\\n      By the quicklime on their boots.\\n\\n   For where a grave had opened wide,\\n      There was no grave at all:\\n   Only a stretch of mud and sand\\n      By the hideous prison-wall,\\n   And a little heap of burning lime,\\n      That the man should have his pall.\\n\\n   For he has a pall, this wretched man,\\n      Such as few men can claim:\\n   Deep down below a prison-yard,\\n      Naked for greater shame,\\n   He lies, with fetters on each foot,\\n      Wrapt in a sheet of flame!\\n\\n   And all the while the burning lime\\n      Eats flesh and bone away,\\n   It eats the brittle bone by night,\\n      And the soft flesh by day,\\n   It eats the flesh and bone by turns,\\n      But it eats the heart alway.\\n\\n   For three long years they will not sow\\n      Or root or seedling there:\\n   For three long years the unblessed spot\\n      Will sterile be and bare,\\n   And look upon the wondering sky\\n      With unreproachful stare.\\n\\n   They think a murderer’s heart would taint\\n      Each simple seed they sow.\\n   It is not true!  God’s kindly earth\\n      Is kindlier than men know,\\n   And the red rose would but blow more red,\\n      The white rose whiter blow.\\n\\n   Out of his mouth a red, red rose!\\n      Out of his heart a white!\\n   For who can say by what strange way,\\n      Christ brings His will to light,\\n   Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore\\n      Bloomed in the great Pope’s sight?\\n\\n   But neither milk-white rose nor red\\n      May bloom in prison-air;\\n   The shard, the pebble, and the flint,\\n      Are what they give us there:\\n   For flowers have been known to heal\\n      A common man’s despair.\\n\\n   So never will wine-red rose or white,\\n      Petal by petal, fall\\n   On that stretch of mud and sand that lies\\n      By the hideous prison-wall,\\n   To tell the men who tramp the yard\\n      That God’s Son died for all.\\n\\n   Yet though the hideous prison-wall\\n      Still hems him round and round,\\n   And a spirit may not walk by night\\n      That is with fetters bound,\\n   And a spirit may but weep that lies\\n      In such unholy ground,\\n\\n   He is at peace—this wretched man—\\n      At peace, or will be soon:\\n   There is no thing to make him mad,\\n      Nor does Terror walk at noon,\\n   For the lampless Earth in which he lies\\n      Has neither Sun nor Moon.\\n\\n   They hanged him as a beast is hanged:\\n      They did not even toll\\n   A requiem that might have brought\\n      Rest to his startled soul,\\n   But hurriedly they took him out,\\n      And hid him in a hole.\\n\\n   They stripped him of his canvas clothes,\\n      And gave him to the flies:\\n   They mocked the swollen purple throat,\\n      And the stark and staring eyes:\\n   And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\\n      In which their convict lies.\\n\\n   The Chaplain would not kneel to pray\\n      By his dishonoured grave:\\n   Nor mark it with that blessed Cross\\n      That Christ for sinners gave,\\n   Because the man was one of those\\n      Whom Christ came down to save.\\n\\n   Yet all is well; he has but passed\\n      To Life’s appointed bourne:\\n   And alien tears will fill for him\\n      Pity’s long-broken urn,\\n   For his mourners will be outcast men,\\n      And outcasts always mourn\\n\\n                                    V\\n\\n   I KNOW not whether Laws be right,\\n      Or whether Laws be wrong;\\n   All that we know who lie in gaol\\n      Is that the wall is strong;\\n   And that each day is like a year,\\n      A year whose days are long.\\n\\n   But this I know, that every Law\\n      That men have made for Man,\\n   Since first Man took his brother’s life,\\n      And the sad world began,\\n   But straws the wheat and saves the chaff\\n      With a most evil fan.\\n\\n   This too I know—and wise it were\\n      If each could know the same—\\n   That every prison that men build\\n      Is built with bricks of shame,\\n   And bound with bars lest Christ should see\\n      How men their brothers maim.\\n\\n   With bars they blur the gracious moon,\\n      And blind the goodly sun:\\n   And they do well to hide their Hell,\\n      For in it things are done\\n   That Son of God nor son of Man\\n      Ever should look upon!\\n\\n   The vilest deeds like poison weeds,\\n      Bloom well in prison-air;\\n   It is only what is good in Man\\n      That wastes and withers there:\\n   Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\\n      And the Warder is Despair.\\n\\n   For they starve the little frightened child\\n      Till it weeps both night and day:\\n   And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\\n      And gibe the old and grey,\\n   And some grow mad, and all grow bad,\\n      And none a word may say.\\n\\n   Each narrow cell in which we dwell\\n      Is a foul and dark latrine,\\n   And the fetid breath of living Death\\n      Chokes up each grated screen,\\n   And all, but Lust, is turned to dust\\n      In Humanity’s machine.\\n\\n   The brackish water that we drink\\n      Creeps with a loathsome slime,\\n   And the bitter bread they weigh in scales\\n      Is full of chalk and lime,\\n   And Sleep will not lie down, but walks\\n      Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.\\n\\n   But though lean Hunger and green Thirst\\n      Like asp with adder fight,\\n   We have little care of prison fare,\\n      For what chills and kills outright\\n   Is that every stone one lifts by day\\n      Becomes one’s heart by night.\\n\\n   With midnight always in one’s heart,\\n      And twilight in one’s cell,\\n   We turn the crank, or tear the rope,\\n      Each in his separate Hell,\\n   And the silence is more awful far\\n      Than the sound of a brazen bell.\\n\\n   And never a human voice comes near\\n      To speak a gentle word:\\n   And the eye that watches through the door\\n      Is pitiless and hard:\\n   And by all forgot, we rot and rot,\\n      With soul and body marred.\\n\\n   And thus we rust Life’s iron chain\\n      Degraded and alone:\\n   And some men curse, and some men weep,\\n      And some men make no moan:\\n   But God’s eternal Laws are kind\\n      And break the heart of stone.\\n\\n   And every human heart that breaks,\\n      In prison-cell or yard,\\n   Is as that broken box that gave\\n      Its treasure to the Lord,\\n   And filled the unclean leper’s house\\n      With the scent of costliest nard.\\n\\n   Ah! happy they whose hearts can break\\n      And peace of pardon win!\\n   How else may man make straight his plan\\n      And cleanse his soul from Sin?\\n   How else but through a broken heart\\n      May Lord Christ enter in?\\n\\n   And he of the swollen purple throat,\\n      And the stark and staring eyes,\\n   Waits for the holy hands that took\\n      The Thief to Paradise;\\n   And a broken and a contrite heart\\n      The Lord will not despise.\\n\\n   The man in red who reads the Law\\n      Gave him three weeks of life,\\n   Three little weeks in which to heal\\n      His soul of his soul’s strife,\\n   And cleanse from every blot of blood\\n      The hand that held the knife.\\n\\n   And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,\\n      The hand that held the steel:\\n   For only blood can wipe out blood,\\n      And only tears can heal:\\n   And the crimson stain that was of Cain\\n      Became Christ’s snow-white seal.\\n\\n                                    VI\\n\\n   IN Reading gaol by Reading town\\n      There is a pit of shame,\\n   And in it lies a wretched man\\n      Eaten by teeth of flame,\\n   In a burning winding-sheet he lies,\\n      And his grave has got no name.\\n\\n   And there, till Christ call forth the dead,\\n      In silence let him lie:\\n   No need to waste the foolish tear,\\n      Or heave the windy sigh:\\n   The man had killed the thing he loved,\\n      And so he had to die.\\n\\n   And all men kill the thing they love,\\n      By all let this be heard,\\n   Some do it with a bitter look,\\n      Some with a flattering word,\\n   The coward does it with a kiss,\\n      The brave man with a sword!\\n\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\nTHE BALLAD OF READING GAOL\\n\\n\\n            A VERSION BASED ON THE ORIGINAL DRAFT OF THE POEM\\n\\n                                    I\\n\\n   HE did not wear his scarlet coat,\\n      For blood and wine are red,\\n   And blood and wine were on his hands\\n      When they found him with the dead,\\n   The poor dead woman whom he loved,\\n      And murdered in her bed.\\n\\n   He walked amongst the Trial Men\\n      In a suit of shabby grey;\\n   A cricket cap was on his head,\\n      And his step seemed light and gay;\\n   But I never saw a man who looked\\n      So wistfully at the day.\\n\\n   I never saw a man who looked\\n      With such a wistful eye\\n   Upon that little tent of blue\\n      Which prisoners call the sky,\\n   And at every drifting cloud that went\\n      With sails of silver by.\\n\\n   I walked, with other souls in pain,\\n      Within another ring,\\n   And was wondering if the man had done\\n      A great or little thing,\\n   When a voice behind me whispered low,\\n      ‘_That fellow’s got to swing_.’\\n\\n   Dear Christ! the very prison walls\\n      Suddenly seemed to reel,\\n   And the sky above my head became\\n      Like a casque of scorching steel;\\n   And, though I was a soul in pain,\\n      My pain I could not feel.\\n\\n   I only knew what hunted thought\\n      Quickened his step, and why\\n   He looked upon the garish day\\n      With such a wistful eye;\\n   The man had killed the thing he loved,\\n      And so he had to die.\\n\\n   Yet each man kills the thing he loves,\\n      By each let this be heard,\\n   Some do it with a bitter look,\\n      Some with a flattering word,\\n   The coward does it with a kiss,\\n      The brave man with a sword!\\n\\n   Some kill their love when they are young,\\n      And some when they are old;\\n   Some strangle with the hands of Lust,\\n      Some with the hands of Gold:\\n   The kindest use a knife, because\\n      The dead so soon grow cold.\\n\\n   Some love too little, some too long,\\n      Some sell, and others buy;\\n   Some do the deed with many tears,\\n      And some without a sigh:\\n   For each man kills the thing he loves,\\n      Yet each man does not die.\\n\\n   He does not die a death of shame\\n      On a day of dark disgrace,\\n   Nor have a noose about his neck,\\n      Nor a cloth upon his face,\\n   Nor drop feet foremost through the floor\\n      Into an empty space.\\n\\n   He does not wake at dawn to see\\n      Dread figures throng his room,\\n   The shivering Chaplain robed in white,\\n      The Sheriff stern with gloom,\\n   And the Governor all in shiny black,\\n      With the yellow face of Doom.\\n\\n   He does not rise in piteous haste\\n      To put on convict-clothes,\\n   While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes\\n      Each new and nerve-twitched pose,\\n   Fingering a watch whose little ticks\\n      Are like horrible hammer-blows.\\n\\n   He does not know that sickening thirst\\n      That sands one’s throat, before\\n   The hangman with his gardener’s gloves\\n      Slips through the padded door,\\n   And binds one with three leathern thongs,\\n      That the throat may thirst no more.\\n\\n   He does not bend his head to hear\\n      The Burial Office read,\\n   Nor, while the terror of his soul\\n      Tells him he is not dead,\\n   Cross his own coffin, as he moves\\n      Into the hideous shed.\\n\\n   He does not stare upon the air\\n      Through a little roof of glass:\\n   He does not pray with lips of clay\\n      For his agony to pass;\\n   Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek\\n      The kiss of Caiaphas.\\n\\n                                    II\\n\\n   SIX weeks our guardsman walked the yard,\\n      In the suit of shabby grey:\\n   His cricket cap was on his head,\\n      And his step seemed light and gay,\\n   But I never saw a man who looked\\n      So wistfully at the day.\\n\\n   He did not wring his hands nor weep,\\n      Nor did he peek or pine,\\n   But he drank the air as though it held\\n      Some healthful anodyne;\\n   With open mouth he drank the sun\\n      As though it had been wine!\\n\\n   And I and all the souls in pain,\\n      Who tramped the other ring,\\n   Forgot if we ourselves had done\\n      A great or little thing,\\n   And watched with gaze of dull amaze\\n      The man who had to swing.\\n\\n   So with curious eyes and sick surmise\\n      We watched him day by day,\\n   And wondered if each one of us\\n      Would end the self-same way,\\n   For none can tell to what red Hell\\n      His sightless soul may stray.\\n\\n   At last the dead man walked no more\\n      Amongst the Trial Men,\\n   And I knew that he was standing up\\n      In the black dock’s dreadful pen,\\n   And that never would I see his face\\n      In God’s sweet world again.\\n\\n   Like two doomed ships that pass in storm\\n      We had crossed each other’s way:\\n   But we made no sign, we said no word,\\n      We had no word to say;\\n   For we did not meet in the holy night,\\n      But in the shameful day.\\n\\n   A prison wall was round us both,\\n      Two outcast men we were:\\n   The world had thrust us from its heart,\\n      And God from out His care:\\n   And the iron gin that waits for Sin\\n      Had caught us in its snare.\\n\\n                                   III\\n\\n   IN Debtors’ Yard the stones are hard,\\n      And the dripping wall is high,\\n   So it was there he took the air\\n      Beneath the leaden sky,\\n   And by each side a Warder walked,\\n      For fear the man might die.\\n\\n   Or else he sat with those who watched\\n      His anguish night and day;\\n   Who watched him when he rose to weep,\\n      And when he crouched to pray;\\n   Who watched him lest himself should rob\\n      Their scaffold of its prey.\\n\\n   And twice a day he smoked his pipe,\\n      And drank his quart of beer:\\n   His soul was resolute, and held\\n      No hiding-place for fear;\\n   He often said that he was glad\\n      The hangman’s hands were near.\\n\\n   But why he said so strange a thing\\n      No Warder dared to ask:\\n   For he to whom a watcher’s doom\\n      Is given as his task,\\n   Must set a lock upon his lips,\\n      And make his face a mask.\\n\\n   With slouch and swing around the ring\\n      We trod the Fools’ Parade!\\n   We did not care: we knew we were\\n      The Devil’s Own Brigade:\\n   And shaven head and feet of lead\\n      Make a merry masquerade.\\n\\n   We tore the tarry rope to shreds\\n      With blunt and bleeding nails;\\n   We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\\n      And cleaned the shining rails:\\n   And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\\n      And clattered with the pails.\\n\\n   We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\\n      We turned the dusty drill:\\n   We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\\n      And sweated on the mill:\\n   But in the heart of every man\\n      Terror was lying still.\\n\\n   So still it lay that every day\\n      Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:\\n   And we forgot the bitter lot\\n      That waits for fool and knave,\\n   Till once, as we tramped in from work,\\n      We passed an open grave.\\n\\n   Right in we went, with soul intent\\n      On Death and Dread and Doom:\\n   The hangman, with his little bag,\\n      Went shuffling through the gloom:\\n   And each man trembled as he crept\\n      Into his numbered tomb.\\n\\n   That night the empty corridors\\n      Were full of forms of Fear,\\n   And up and down the iron town\\n      Stole feet we could not hear,\\n   And through the bars that hide the stars\\n      White faces seemed to peer.\\n\\n   But there is no sleep when men must weep\\n      Who never yet have wept:\\n   So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—\\n      That endless vigil kept,\\n   And through each brain on hands of pain\\n      Another’s terror crept.\\n\\n   Alas! it is a fearful thing\\n      To feel another’s guilt!\\n   For, right within, the sword of Sin\\n      Pierced to its poisoned hilt,\\n   And as molten lead were the tears we shed\\n      For the blood we had not spilt.\\n\\n   The Warders with their shoes of felt\\n      Crept by each padlocked door,\\n   And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\\n      Grey figures on the floor,\\n   And wondered why men knelt to pray\\n      Who never prayed before.\\n\\n   The morning wind began to moan,\\n      But still the night went on:\\n   Through its giant loom the web of gloom\\n      Crept till each thread was spun:\\n   And, as we prayed, we grew afraid\\n      Of the Justice of the Sun.\\n\\n   At last I saw the shadowed bars,\\n      Like a lattice wrought in lead,\\n   Move right across the whitewashed wall\\n      That faced my three-plank bed,\\n   And I knew that somewhere in the world\\n      God’s dreadful dawn was red.\\n\\n   At six o’clock we cleaned our cells,\\n      At seven all was still,\\n   But the sough and swing of a mighty wing\\n      The prison seemed to fill,\\n   For the Lord of Death with icy breath\\n      Had entered in to kill.\\n\\n   He did not pass in purple pomp,\\n      Nor ride a moon-white steed.\\n   Three yards of cord and a sliding board\\n      Are all the gallows’ need:\\n   So with rope of shame the Herald came\\n      To do the secret deed.\\n\\n   We waited for the stroke of eight:\\n      Each tongue was thick with thirst:\\n   For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\\n      That makes a man accursed,\\n   And Fate will use a running noose\\n      For the best man and the worst.\\n\\n   We had no other thing to do,\\n      Save to wait for the sign to come:\\n   So, like things of stone in a valley lone,\\n      Quiet we sat and dumb:\\n   But each man’s heart beat thick and quick,\\n      Like a madman on a drum!\\n\\n   With sudden shock the prison-clock\\n      Smote on the shivering air,\\n   And from all the gaol rose up a wail\\n      Of impotent despair,\\n   Like the sound that frightened marshes hear\\n      From some leper in his lair.\\n\\n   And as one sees most fearful things\\n      In the crystal of a dream,\\n   We saw the greasy hempen rope\\n      Hooked to the blackened beam,\\n   And heard the prayer the hangman’s snare\\n      Strangled into a scream.\\n\\n   And all the woe that moved him so\\n      That he gave that bitter cry,\\n   And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\\n      None knew so well as I:\\n   For he who lives more lives than one\\n      More deaths than one must die.\\n\\n                                    IV\\n\\n   THERE is no chapel on the day\\n      On which they hang a man:\\n   The Chaplain’s heart is far too sick,\\n      Or his face is far too wan,\\n   Or there is that written in his eyes\\n      Which none should look upon.\\n\\n   So they kept us close till nigh on noon,\\n      And then they rang the bell,\\n   And the Warders with their jingling keys\\n      Opened each listening cell,\\n   And down the iron stair we tramped,\\n      Each from his separate Hell.\\n\\n   Out into God’s sweet air we went,\\n      But not in wonted way,\\n   For this man’s face was white with fear,\\n      And that man’s face was grey,\\n   And I never saw sad men who looked\\n      So wistfully at the day.\\n\\n   I never saw sad men who looked\\n      With such a wistful eye\\n   Upon that little tent of blue\\n      We prisoners called the sky,\\n   And at every careless cloud that passed\\n      In happy freedom by.\\n\\n   But there were those amongst us all\\n      Who walked with downcast head,\\n   And knew that, had each got his due,\\n      They should have died instead:\\n   He had but killed a thing that lived,\\n      Whilst they had killed the dead.\\n\\n   For he who sins a second time\\n      Wakes a dead soul to pain,\\n   And draws it from its spotted shroud,\\n      And makes it bleed again,\\n   And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,\\n      And makes it bleed in vain!\\n\\n   Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb\\n      With crooked arrows starred,\\n   Silently we went round and round\\n      The slippery asphalte yard;\\n   Silently we went round and round,\\n      And no man spoke a word.\\n\\n   Silently we went round and round,\\n      And through each hollow mind\\n   The Memory of dreadful things\\n      Rushed like a dreadful wind,\\n   And Horror stalked before each man,\\n      And Terror crept behind.\\n\\n   The Warders strutted up and down,\\n      And kept their herd of brutes,\\n   Their uniforms were spick and span,\\n      And they wore their Sunday suits,\\n   But we knew the work they had been at,\\n      By the quicklime on their boots.\\n\\n   For where a grave had opened wide,\\n      There was no grave at all:\\n   Only a stretch of mud and sand\\n      By the hideous prison-wall,\\n   And a little heap of burning lime,\\n      That the man should have his pall.\\n\\n   For he has a pall, this wretched man,\\n      Such as few men can claim:\\n   Deep down below a prison-yard,\\n      Naked for greater shame,\\n   He lies, with fetters on each foot,\\n      Wrapt in a sheet of flame!\\n\\n   For three long years they will not sow\\n      Or root or seedling there:\\n   For three long years the unblessed spot\\n      Will sterile be and bare,\\n   And look upon the wondering sky\\n      With

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.

LANGTRY AS HESTER GRAZEBROOK\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is only in the best Greek gems, on the silver coins of Syracuse,\\nor among the marble figures of the Parthenon frieze, that one can\\nfind the ideal representation of the marvellous beauty of that face\\nwhich laughed through the leaves last night as Hester Grazebrook.\\n\\nPure Greek it is, with the grave low forehead, the exquisitely\\narched brow; the noble chiselling of the mouth, shaped as if it\\nwere the mouthpiece of an instrument of music; the supreme and\\nsplendid curve of the cheek; the augustly pillared throat which\\nbears it all:  it is Greek, because the lines which compose it are\\nso definite and so strong, and yet so exquisitely harmonized that\\nthe effect is one of simple loveliness purely:  Greek, because its\\nessence and its quality, as is the quality of music and of\\narchitecture, is that of beauty based on absolutely mathematical\\nlaws.\\n\\nBut while art remains dumb and immobile in its passionless\\nserenity, with the beauty of this face it is different:  the grey\\neyes lighten into blue or deepen into violet as fancy succeeds\\nfancy; the lips become flower-like in laughter or, tremulous as a\\nbird\\'s wing, mould themselves at last into the strong and bitter\\nmoulds of pain or scorn.  And then motion comes, and the statue\\nwakes into life.  But the life is not the ordinary life of common\\ndays; it is life with a new value given to it, the value of art:\\nand the charm to me of Hester Grazebrook\\'s acting in the first\\nscene of the play last night was that mingling of classic grace\\nwith absolute reality which is the secret of all beautiful art, of\\nthe plastic work of the Greeks and of the pictures of Jean Francois\\nMillet equally.\\n\\nI do not think that the sovereignty and empire of women\\'s beauty\\nhas at all passed away, though we may no longer go to war for them\\nas the Greeks did for the daughter of Leda.  The greatest empire\\nstill remains for them--the empire of art.  And, indeed, this\\nwonderful face, seen last night for the first time in America, has\\nfilled and permeated with the pervading image of its type the whole\\nof our modern art in England.  Last century it was the romantic\\ntype which dominated in art, the type loved by Reynolds and\\nGainsborough, of wonderful contrasts of colour, of exquisite and\\nvarying charm of expression, but without that definite plastic\\nfeeling which divides classic from romantic work.  This type\\ndegenerated into mere facile prettiness in the hands of lesser\\nmasters, and, in protest against it, was created by the hands of\\nthe Pre-Raphaelites a new type, with its rare combination of Greek\\nform with Florentine mysticism.  But this mysticism becomes over-\\nstrained and a burden, rather than an aid to expression, and a\\ndesire for the pure Hellenic joy and serenity came in its place;\\nand in all our modern work, in the paintings of such men as Albert\\nMoore and Leighton and Whistler, we can trace the influence of this\\nsingle face giving fresh life and inspiration in the form of a new\\nartistic ideal.\\n\\n\\n\\nSLAVES OF FASHION\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Leffler-Arnim\\'s statement, in a lecture delivered recently at\\nSt. Saviour\\'s Hospital, that \"she had heard of instances where\\nladies were so determined not to exceed the fashionable measurement\\nthat they had actually held on to a cross-bar while their maids\\nfastened the fifteen-inch corset,\" has excited a good deal of\\nincredulity, but there is nothing really improbable in it.  From\\nthe sixteenth century to our own day there is hardly any form of\\ntorture that has not been inflicted on girls, and endured by women,\\nin obedience to the dictates of an unreasonable and monstrous\\nFashion.  \"In order to obtain a real Spanish figure,\" says\\nMontaigne, \"what a Gehenna of suffering will not women endure,\\ndrawn in and compressed by great coches entering the flesh; nay,\\nsometimes they even die thereof!\"  \"A few days after my arrival at\\nschool,\" Mrs. Somerville tells us in her memoirs, \"although\\nperfectly straight and well made, I was enclosed in stiff stays,\\nwith a steel busk in front; while above my frock, bands drew my\\nshoulders back till the shoulder-blades met.  Then a steel rod with\\na semi-circle, which went under my chin, was clasped to the steel\\nbusk in my stays.  In this constrained state I and most of the\\nyounger girls had to prepare our lessons\"; and in the life of Miss\\nEdgeworth we read that, being sent to a certain fashionable\\nestablishment, \"she underwent all the usual tortures of back-\\nboards, iron collars and dumbs, and also (because she was a very\\ntiny person) the unusual one of being hung by the neck to draw out\\nthe muscles and increase the growth,\" a signal failure in her case.\\nIndeed, instances of absolute mutilation and misery are so common\\nin the past that it is unnecessary to multiply them; but it is\\nreally sad to think that in our own day a civilized woman can hang\\non to a cross-bar while her maid laces her waist into a fifteen-\\ninch circle.  To begin with, the waist is not a circle at all, but\\nan oval; nor can there be any greater error than to imagine that an\\nunnaturally small waist gives an air of grace, or even of\\nslightness, to the whole figure.  Its effect, as a rule, is simply\\nto exaggerate the width of the shoulders and the hips; and those\\nwhose figures possess that stateliness which is called stoutness by\\nthe vulgar, convert what is a quality into a defect by yielding to\\nthe silly edicts of Fashion on the subject of tight-lacing.  The\\nfashionable English waist, also, is not merely far too small, and\\nconsequently quite out of proportion to the rest of the figure, but\\nit is worn far too low down.  I use the expression \"worn\"\\nadvisedly, for a waist nowadays seems to be regarded as an article\\nof apparel to be put on when and where one likes.  A long waist\\nalways implies shortness of the lower limbs, and, from the artistic\\npoint of view, has the effect of diminishing the height; and I am\\nglad to see that many of the most charming women in Paris are\\nreturning to the idea of the Directoire style of dress.  This style\\nis not by any means perfect, but at least it has the merit of\\nindicating the proper position of the waist.  I feel quite sure\\nthat all English women of culture and position will set their faces\\nagainst such stupid and dangerous practices as are related by Miss\\nLeffler-Arnim.  Fashion\\'s motto is:  Il faut souffrir pour etre\\nbelle; but the motto of art and of common-sense is:  Il faut etre\\nbete pour souffrir.\\n\\nTalking of Fashion, a critic in the Pall Mall Gazelle expresses his\\nsurprise that I should have allowed an illustration of a hat,\\ncovered with \"the bodies of dead birds,\" to appear in the first\\nnumber of the Woman\\'s World; and as I have received many letters on\\nthe subject, it is only right that I should state my exact position\\nin the matter.  Fashion is such an essential part of the mundus\\nmuliebris of our day, that it seems to me absolutely necessary that\\nits growth, development, and phases should be duly chronicled; and\\nthe historical and practical value of such a record depends\\nentirely upon its perfect fidelity to fact.  Besides, it is quite\\neasy for the children of light to adapt almost any fashionable form\\nof dress to the requirements of utility and the demands of good\\ntaste.  The Sarah Bernhardt tea-gown, for instance, figured in the\\npresent issue, has many good points about it, and the gigantic\\ndress-improver does not appear to me to be really essential to the\\nmode; and though the Postillion costume of the fancy dress ball is\\nabsolutely detestable in its silliness and vulgarity, the so-called\\nLate Georgian costume in the same plate is rather pleasing.  I\\nmust, however, protest against the idea that to chronicle the\\ndevelopment of Fashion implies any approval of the particular forms\\nthat Fashion may adopt.\\n\\n\\n\\nWOMAN\\'S DRESS\\n\\n\\n\\nThe \"Girl Graduate\" must of course have precedence, not merely for\\nher sex but for her sanity:  her letter is extremely sensible.  She\\nmakes two points:  that high heels are a necessity for any lady who\\nwishes to keep her dress clean from the Stygian mud of our streets,\\nand that without a tight corset the ordinary number of petticoats\\nand etceteras\\' cannot be properly or conveniently held up.  Now, it\\nis quite true that as long as the lower garments are suspended from\\nthe hips a corset is an absolute necessity; the mistake lies in not\\nsuspending all apparel from the shoulders.  In the latter case a\\ncorset becomes useless, the body is left free and unconfined for\\nrespiration and motion, there is more health, and consequently more\\nbeauty.  Indeed all the most ungainly and uncomfortable articles of\\ndress that fashion has ever in her folly prescribed, not the tight\\ncorset merely, but the farthingale, the vertugadin, the hoop, the\\ncrinoline, and that modern monstrosity the so-called \"dress\\nimprover\" also, all of them have owed their origin to the same\\nerror, the error of not seeing that it is from the shoulders, and\\nfrom the shoulders only, that all garments should be hung.\\n\\nAnd as regards high heels, I quite admit that some additional\\nheight to the shoe or boot is necessary if long gowns are to be\\nworn in the street; but what I object to is that the height should\\nbe given to the heel only, and not to the sole of the foot also.\\nThe modern high-heeled boot is, in fact, merely the clog of the\\ntime of Henry VI., with the front prop left out, and its inevitable\\neffect is to throw the body forward, to shorten the steps, and\\nconsequently to produce that want of grace which always follows\\nwant of freedom.\\n\\nWhy should clogs be despised?  Much art has been expended on clogs.\\nThey have been made of lovely woods, and delicately inlaid with\\nivory, and with mother-of-pearl.  A clog might be a dream of\\nbeauty, and, if not too high or too heavy, most comfortable also.\\nBut if there be any who do not like clogs, let them try some\\nadaptation of the trouser of the Turkish lady, which is loose round\\nthe limb and tight at the ankle.\\n\\nThe \"Girl Graduate,\" with a pathos to which I am not insensible,\\nentreats me not to apotheosize \"that awful, befringed, beflounced,\\nand bekilted divided skirt.\"  Well, I will acknowledge that the\\nfringes, the flounces, and the kilting do certainly defeat the\\nwhole object of the dress, which is that of ease and liberty; but I\\nregard these things as mere wicked superfluities, tragic proofs\\nthat the divided skirt is ashamed of its own division.  The\\nprinciple of the dress is good, and, though it is not by any means\\nperfection, it is a step towards it.\\n\\nHere I leave the \"Girl Graduate,\" with much regret, for Mr.\\nWentworth Huyshe.  Mr. Huyshe makes the old criticism that Greek\\ndress is unsuited to our climate, and, to me the somewhat new\\nassertion, that the men\\'s dress of a hundred years ago was\\npreferable to that of the second part of the seventeenth century,\\nwhich I consider to have been the exquisite period of English\\ncostume.\\n\\nNow, as regards the first of these two statements, I will say, to\\nbegin with, that the warmth of apparel does not depend really on\\nthe number of garments worn, but on the material of which they are\\nmade.  One of the chief faults of modern dress is that it is\\ncomposed of far too many articles of clothing, most of which are of\\nthe wrong substance; but over a substratum of pure wool, such as is\\nsupplied by Dr. Jaeger under the modern German system, some\\nmodification of Greek costume is perfectly applicable to our\\nclimate, our country and our century.  This important fact has\\nalready been pointed out by Mr. E. W. Godwin in his excellent,\\nthough too brief handbook on Dress, contributed to the Health\\nExhibition.  I call it an important fact because it makes almost\\nany form of lovely costume perfectly practicable in our cold\\nclimate.  Mr. Godwin, it is true, points out that the English\\nladies of the thirteenth century abandoned after some time the\\nflowing garments of the early Renaissance in favour of a tighter\\nmode, such as Northern Europe seems to demand.  This I quite admit,\\nand its significance; but what I contend, and what I am sure Mr.\\nGodwin would agree with me in, is that the principles, the laws of\\nGreek dress may be perfectly realized, even in a moderately tight\\ngown with sleeves:  I mean the principle of suspending all apparel\\nfrom the shoulders, and of relying for beauty of effect not on the\\nstiff ready-made ornaments of the modern milliner--the bows where\\nthere should be no bows, and the flounces where there should be no\\nflounces--but on the exquisite play of light and line that one gets\\nfrom rich and rippling folds.  I am not proposing any antiquarian\\nrevival of an ancient costume, but trying merely to point out the\\nright laws of dress, laws which are dictated by art and not by\\narchaeology, by science and not by fashion; and just as the best\\nwork of art in our days is that which combines classic grace with\\nabsolute reality, so from a continuation of the Greek principles of\\nbeauty with the German principles of health will come, I feel\\ncertain, the costume of the future.\\n\\nAnd now to the question of men\\'s dress, or rather to Mr. Huyshe\\'s\\nclaim of the superiority, in point of costume, of the last quarter\\nof the eighteenth century over the second quarter of the\\nseventeenth.  The broad-brimmed hat of 1640 kept the rain of winter\\nand the glare of summer from the face; the same cannot be said of\\nthe hat of one hundred years ago, which, with its comparatively\\nnarrow brim and high crown, was the precursor of the modern\\n\"chimney-pot\":  a wide turned-down collar is a healthier thing than\\na strangling stock, and a short cloak much more comfortable than a\\nsleeved overcoat, even though the latter may have had \"three\\ncapes\"; a cloak is easier to put on and off, lies lightly on the\\nshoulder in summer, and wrapped round one in winter keeps one\\nperfectly warm.  A doublet, again, is simpler than a coat and\\nwaistcoat; instead of two garments one has one; by not being open\\nalso it protects the chest better.\\n\\nShort loose trousers are in every way to be preferred to the tight\\nknee-breeches which often impede the proper circulation of the\\nblood; and finally, the soft leather boots which could be worn\\nabove or below the knee, are more supple, and give consequently\\nmore freedom, than the stiff Hessian which Mr. Huyshe so praises.\\nI say nothing about the question of grace and picturesqueness, for\\nI suppose that no one, not even Mr. Huyshe, would prefer a\\nmaccaroni to a cavalier, a Lawrence to a Vandyke, or the third\\nGeorge to the first Charles; but for ease, warmth and comfort this\\nseventeenth-century dress is infinitely superior to anything that\\ncame after it, and I do not think it is excelled by any preceding\\nform of costume.  I sincerely trust that we may soon see in England\\nsome national revival of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nMORE RADICAL IDEAS UPON DRESS REFORM\\n\\n\\n\\nI have been much interested at reading the large amount of\\ncorrespondence that has been called forth by my recent lecture on\\nDress.  It shows me that the subject of dress reform is one that is\\noccupying many wise and charming people, who have at heart the\\nprinciples of health, freedom, and beauty in costume, and I hope\\nthat \"H. B. T.\" and \"Materfamilias\" will have all the real\\ninfluence which their letters--excellent letters both of them--\\ncertainly deserve.\\n\\nI turn first to Mr. Huyshe\\'s second letter, and the drawing that\\naccompanies it; but before entering into any examination of the\\ntheory contained in each, I think I should state at once that I\\nhave absolutely no idea whether this gentleman wears his hair long\\nor short, or his cuffs back or forward, or indeed what he is like\\nat all.  I hope he consults his own comfort and wishes in\\neverything which has to do with his dress, and is allowed to enjoy\\nthat individualism in apparel which he so eloquently claims for\\nhimself, and so foolishly tries to deny to others; but I really\\ncould not take Mr. Wentworth Huyshe\\'s personal appearance as any\\nintellectual basis for an investigation of the principles which\\nshould guide the costume of a nation.  I am not denying the force,\\nor even the popularity, of the \"\\'Eave arf a brick\" school of\\ncriticism, but I acknowledge it does not interest me.  The gamin in\\nthe gutter may be a necessity, but the gamin in discussion is a\\nnuisance.  So I will proceed at once to the real point at issue,\\nthe value of the late eighteenth-century costume over that worn in\\nthe second quarter of the seventeenth:  the relative merits, that\\nis, of the principles contained in each.  Now, as regards the\\neighteenth-century costume, Mr. Wentworth Huyshe acknowledges that\\nhe has had no practical experience of it at all; in fact he makes a\\npathetic appeal to his friends to corroborate him in his assertion,\\nwhich I do not question for a moment, that he has never been\\n\"guilty of the eccentricity\" of wearing himself the dress which he\\nproposes for general adoption by others.  There is something so\\nnaive and so amusing about this last passage in Mr. Huyshe\\'s letter\\nthat I am really in doubt whether I am not doing him a wrong in\\nregarding him as having any serious, or sincere, views on the\\nquestion of a possible reform in dress; still, as irrespective of\\nany attitude of Mr. Huyshe\\'s in the matter, the subject is in\\nitself an interesting one, I think it is worth continuing,\\nparticularly as I have myself worn this late eighteenth-century\\ndress many times, both in public and in private, and so may claim\\nto have a very positive right to speak on its comfort and\\nsuitability.  The particular form of the dress I wore was very\\nsimilar to that given in Mr. Godwin\\'s handbook, from a print of\\nNorthcote\\'s, and had a certain elegance and grace about it which\\nwas very charming; still, I gave it up for these reasons:- After a\\nfurther consideration of the laws of dress I saw that a doublet is\\na far simpler and easier garment than a coat and waistcoat, and, if\\nbuttoned from the shoulder, far warmer also, and that tails have no\\nplace in costume, except on some Darwinian theory of heredity; from\\nabsolute experience in the matter I found that the excessive\\ntightness of knee-breeches is not really comfortable if one wears\\nthem constantly; and, in fact, I satisfied myself that the dress is\\nnot one founded on any real principles.  The broad-brimmed hat and\\nloose cloak, which, as my object was not, of course, historical\\naccuracy but modern ease, I had always worn with the costume in\\nquestion, I have still retained, and find them most comfortable.\\n\\nWell, although Mr. Huyshe has no real experience of the dress he\\nproposes, he gives us a drawing of it, which he labels, somewhat\\nprematurely, \"An ideal dress.\"  An ideal dress of course it is not;\\n\"passably picturesque,\" he says I may possibly think it; well,\\npassably picturesque it may be, but not beautiful, certainly,\\nsimply because it is not founded on right principles, or, indeed,\\non any principles at all.  Picturesqueness one may get in a variety\\nof ways; ugly things that are strange, or unfamiliar to us, for\\ninstance, may be picturesque, such as a late sixteenth-century\\ncostume, or a Georgian house.  Ruins, again, may be picturesque,\\nbut beautiful they never can be, because their lines are\\nmeaningless.  Beauty, in fact, is to be got only from the\\nperfection of principles; and in \"the ideal dress\" of Mr. Huyshe\\nthere are no ideas or principles at all, much less the perfection\\nof either.  Let us examine it, and see its faults; they are obvious\\nto any one who desires more than a \"Fancy-dress ball\" basis for\\ncostume.  To begin with, the hat and boots are all wrong.  Whatever\\none wears on the extremities, such as the feet and head, should,\\nfor the sake of comfort, be made of a soft material, and for the\\nsake of freedom should take its shape from the way one chooses to\\nwear it, and not from any stiff, stereotyped design of hat or boot\\nmaker.  In a hat made on right principles one should be able to\\nturn the brim up or down according as the day is dark or fair, dry\\nor wet; but the hat brim of Mr. Huyshe\\'s drawing is perfectly\\nstiff, and does not give much protection to the face, or the\\npossibility of any at all to the back of the head or the ears, in\\ncase of a cold east wind; whereas the bycocket, a hat made in\\naccordance with the right laws, can be turned down behind and at\\nthe sides, and so give the same warmth as a hood.  The crown,\\nagain, of Mr. Huyshe\\'s hat is far too high; a high crown diminishes\\nthe stature of a small person, and in the case of any one who is\\ntall is a great inconvenience when one is getting in and out of\\nhansoms and railway carriages, or passing under a street awning:\\nin no case is it of any value whatsoever, and being useless it is\\nof course against the principles of dress.\\n\\nAs regards the boots, they are not quite so ugly or so\\nuncomfortable as the hat; still they are evidently made of stiff\\nleather, as otherwise they would fall down to the ankle, whereas\\nthe boot should be made of soft leather always, and if worn high at\\nall must be either laced up the front or carried well over the\\nknee:  in the latter case one combines perfect freedom for walking\\ntogether with perfect protection against rain, neither of which\\nadvantages a short stiff boot will ever give one, and when one is\\nresting in the house the long soft boot can be turned down as the\\nboot of 1640 was.  Then there is the overcoat:  now, what are the\\nright principles of an overcoat?  To begin with, it should be\\ncapable of being easily put on or off, and worn over any kind of\\ndress; consequently it should never have narrow sleeves, such as\\nare shown in Mr. Huyshe\\'s drawing.  If an opening or slit for the\\narm is required it should be made quite wide, and may be protected\\nby a flap, as in that excellent overall the modern Inverness cape;\\nsecondly, it should not be too tight, as otherwise all freedom of\\nwalking is impeded.  If the young gentleman in the drawing buttons\\nhis overcoat he may succeed in being statuesque, though that I\\ndoubt very strongly, but he will never succeed in being swift; his\\nsuper-totus is made for him on no principle whatsoever; a super-\\ntotus, or overall, should be capable of being worn long or short,\\nquite loose or moderately tight, just as the wearer wishes; he\\nshould be able to have one arm free and one arm covered or both\\narms free or both arms covered, just as he chooses for his\\nconvenience in riding, walking, or driving; an overall again should\\nnever be heavy, and should always be warm:  lastly, it should be\\ncapable of being easily carried if one wants to take it off; in\\nfact, its principles are those of freedom and comfort, and a cloak\\nrealizes them all, just as much as an overcoat of the pattern\\nsuggested by Mr. Huyshe violates them.\\n\\nThe knee-breeches are of course far too tight; any one who has worn\\nthem for any length of time--any one, in fact, whose views on the\\nsubject are not purely theoretical--will agree with me there; like\\neverything else in the dress, they are a great mistake.  The\\nsubstitution of the jacket for the coat and waistcoat of the period\\nis a step in the right direction, which I am glad to see; it is,\\nhowever, far too tight over the hips for any possible comfort.\\nWhenever a jacket or doublet comes below the waist it should be\\nslit at each side.  In the seventeenth century the skirt of the\\njacket was sometimes laced on by points and tags, so that it could\\nbe removed at will, sometimes it was merely left open at the sides:\\nin each case it exemplified what are always the true principles of\\ndress, I mean freedom and adaptability to circumstances.\\n\\nFinally, as regards drawings of this kind, I would point out that\\nthere is absolutely no limit at all to the amount of \"passably\\npicturesque\" costumes which can be either revived or invented for\\nus; but that unless a costume is founded on principles and\\nexemplified laws, it never can be of any real value to us in the\\nreform of dress.  This particular drawing of Mr. Huyshe\\'s, for\\ninstance, proves absolutely nothing, except that our grandfathers\\ndid not understand the proper laws of dress.  There is not a single\\nrule of right costume which is not violated in it, for it gives us\\nstiffness, tightness and discomfort instead of comfort, freedom and\\nease.\\n\\nNow here, on the other hand, is a dress which, being founded on\\nprinciples, can serve us as an excellent guide and model; it has\\nbeen drawn for me, most kindly, by Mr. Godwin from the Duke of\\nNewcastle\\'s delightful book on horsemanship, a book which is one of\\nour best authorities on our best era of costume.  I do not of\\ncourse propose it necessarily for absolute imitation; that is not\\nthe way in which one should regard it; it is not, I mean, a revival\\nof a dead costume, but a realization of living laws.  I give it as\\nan example of a particular application of principles which are\\nuniversally right.  This rationally dressed young man can turn his\\nhat brim down if it rains, and his loose trousers and boots down if\\nhe is tired--that is, he can adapt his costume to circumstances;\\nthen he enjoys perfect freedom, the arms and legs are not made\\nawkward or uncomfortable by the excessive tightness of narrow\\nsleeves and knee-breeches, and the hips are left quite\\nuntrammelled, always an important point; and as regards comfort,\\nhis jacket is not too loose for warmth, nor too close for\\nrespiration; his neck is well protected without being strangled,\\nand even his ostrich feathers, if any Philistine should object to\\nthem, are not merely dandyism, but fan him very pleasantly, I am\\nsure, in summer, and when the weather is bad they are no doubt left\\nat home, and his cloak taken out.  THE VALUE OF THE DRESS IS SIMPLY\\nTHAT EVERY SEPARATE ARTICLE OF IT EXPRESSES A LAW.  My young man is\\nconsequently apparelled with ideas, while Mr. Huyshe\\'s young man is\\nstiffened with facts; the latter teaches one nothing; from the\\nformer one learns everything.  I need hardly say that this dress is\\ngood, not because it is seventeenth century, but because it is\\nconstructed on the true principles of costume, just as a square\\nlintel or pointed arch is good, not because one may be Greek and\\nthe other Gothic, but because each of them is the best method of\\nspanning a certain-sized opening, or resisting a certain weight.\\nThe fact, however, that this dress was generally worn in England\\ntwo centuries and a half ago shows at least this, that the right\\nlaws of dress have been understood and realized in our country, and\\nso in our country may be realized and understood again.  As regards\\nthe absolute beauty of this dress and its meaning, I should like to\\nsay a few words more.  Mr. Wentworth Huyshe solemnly announces that\\n\"he and those who think with him\" cannot permit this question of\\nbeauty to be imported into the question of dress; that he and those\\nwho think with him take \"practical views on the subject,\" and so\\non.  Well, I will not enter here into a discussion as to how far\\nany one who does not take beauty and the value of beauty into\\naccount can claim to be practical at all.  The word practical is\\nnearly always the last refuge of the uncivilized.  Of all misused\\nwords it is the most evilly treated.  But what I want to point out\\nis that beauty is essentially organic; that is, it comes, not from\\nwithout, but from within, not from any added prettiness, but from\\nthe perfection of its own being; and that consequently, as the body\\nis beautiful, so all apparel that rightly clothes it must be\\nbeautiful also in its construction and in its lines.\\n\\nI have no more desire to define ugliness than I have daring to\\ndefine beauty; but still I would like to remind those who mock at\\nbeauty as being an unpractical thing of this fact, that an ugly\\nthing is merely a thing that is badly made, or a thing that does\\nnot serve it purpose; that ugliness is want of fitness; that\\nugliness is failure; that ugliness is uselessness, such as ornament\\nin the wrong place, while beauty, as some one finely said, is the\\npurgation of all superfluities.  There is a divine economy about\\nbeauty; it gives us just what is needful and no more, whereas\\nugliness is always extravagant; ugliness is a spendthrift and\\nwastes its material; in fine, ugliness--and I would commend this\\nremark to Mr. Wentworth Huyshe--ugliness, as much in costume as in\\nanything else, is always the sign that somebody has been\\nunpractical.  So the costume of the future in England, if it is\\nfounded on the true laws of freedom, comfort, and adaptability to\\ncircumstances, cannot fail to be most beautiful also, because\\nbeauty is the sign always of the rightness of principles, the\\nmystical seal that is set upon what is perfect, and upon what is\\nperfect only.\\n\\nAs for your other correspondent, the first principle of dress that\\nall garments should be hung from the shoulders and not from the\\nwaist seems to me to be generally approved of, although an \"Old\\nSailor\" declares that no sailors or athletes ever suspend their\\nclothes from the shoulders, but always from the hips.  My own\\nrecollection of the river and running ground at Oxford--those two\\nhomes of Hellenism in our little Gothic town--is that the best\\nrunners and rowers (and my own college turned out many) wore always\\na tight jersey, with short drawers attached to it, the whole\\ncostume being woven in one piece.  As for sailors, it is true, I\\nadmit, and the bad custom seems to involve that constant \"hitching\\nup\" of the lower garments which, however popular in transpontine\\ndramas, cannot, I think, but be considered an extremely awkward\\nhabit; and as all awkwardness comes from discomfort of some kind, I\\ntrust that this point in our sailor\\'s dress will be looked to in\\nthe coming reform of our navy, for, in spite of all protests, I\\nhope we are about to reform everything, from torpedoes to top-hats,\\nand from crinolettes to cruises.\\n\\nThen as regards clogs, my suggestion of them seems to have aroused\\na great deal of terror.  Fashion in her high-heeled boots has\\nscreamed, and the dreadful word \"anachronism\" has been used.  Now,\\nwhatever is useful cannot be an anachronism.  Such a word is\\napplicable only to the revival of some folly; and, besides, in the\\nEngland of our own day clogs are still worn in many of our\\nmanufacturing towns, such as Oldham.  I fear that in Oldham they\\nmay not be dreams of beauty; in Oldham the art of inlaying them\\nwith ivory and with pearl may possibly be unknown; yet in Oldham\\nthey serve their purpose.  Nor is it so long since they were worn\\nby the upper classes of this country generally.  Only a few days\\nago I had the pleasure of talking to a lady who remembered with\\naffectionate regret the clogs of her girlhood; they were, according\\nto her, not too high nor too heavy, and were provided, besides,\\nwith some kind of spring in the sole so as to make them the more\\nsupple for the foot in walking.  Personally, I object to all\\nadditional height being given to a boot or shoe; it is really\\nagainst the proper principles of dress, although, if any such\\nheight is to be given it should be by means of two props; not one;\\nbut what I should prefer to see is some adaptation of the divided\\nskirt or long and moderately loose knickerbockers.  If, however,\\nthe divided skirt is to be of any positive value, it must give up\\nall idea of \"being identical in appearance with an ordinary skirt\";\\nit must diminish the moderate width of each of its divisions, and\\nsacrifice its foolish frills and flounces; the moment it imitates a\\ndress it is lost; but let it visibly announce itself as what it\\nactually is, and it will go far towards solving a real difficulty.\\nI feel sure that there will be found many graceful and charming\\ngirls ready to adopt a costume founded on these principles, in\\nspite of Mr. Wentworth Huyshe\\'s terrible threat that he will not\\npropose to them as long as they wear it, for all charges of a want\\nof womanly character in these forms of dress are really\\nmeaningless; every right article of apparel belongs equally to both\\nsexes, and there is absolutely no such thing as a definitely\\nfeminine garment.  One word of warning I should like to be allowed\\nto give:  The over-tunic should be made full and moderately loose;\\nit may, if desired, be shaped more or less to the figure, but in no\\ncase should it be confined at the waist by any straight band or\\nbelt; on the contrary, it should fall from the shoulder to the\\nknee, or below it, in fine curves and vertical lines, giving more\\nfreedom and consequently more grace.  Few garments are so\\nabsolutely unbecoming as a belted tunic that reaches to the knees,\\na fact which I wish some of our Rosalinds would consider when they\\ndon doublet and hose; indeed, to the disregard of this artistic\\nprinciple is due the ugliness, the want of proportion, in the\\nBloomer costume, a costume which in other respects is sensible.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOSTUME\\n\\n\\n\\nAre we not all weary of him, that venerable impostor fresh from the\\nsteps of the Piazza di Spagna, who, in the leisure moments that he\\ncan spare from his customary organ, makes the round of the studios\\nand is waited for in Holland Park?  Do we not all recognize him,\\nwhen, with the gay insouciance of his nation, he reappears on the\\nwalls of our summer exhibitions as everything that he is not, and\\nas nothing that he is, glaring at us here as a patriarch of Canaan,\\nhere beaming as a brigand from the Abruzzi?  Popular is he, this\\npoor peripatetic professor of posing, with those whose joy it is to\\npaint the posthumous portrait of the last philanthropist who in his\\nlifetime had neglected to be photographed,--yet he is the sign of\\nthe decadence, the symbol of decay.\\n\\nFor all costumes are caricatures.  The basis of Art is not the\\nFancy Ball.  Where there is loveliness of dress, there is no\\ndressing up.  And so, were our national attire delightful in\\ncolour, and in construction simple and sincere; were dress the\\nexpression of the loveliness that it shields and of the swiftness\\nand motion that it does not impede; did its lines break from the\\nshoulder instead of bulging from the waist; did the inverted\\nwineglass cease to be the ideal of form; were these things brought\\nabout, as brought about they will be, then would painting be no\\nlonger an artificial reaction against the ugliness of life, but\\nbecome, as it should be, the natural expression of life\\'s beauty.\\nNor would painting merely, but all the other arts also, be the\\ngainers by a change such as that which I propose; the gainers, I\\nmean, through the increased atmosphere of Beauty by which the\\nartists would be surrounded and in which they would grow up.  For\\nArt is not to be taught in Academies.  It is what one looks at, not\\nwhat one listens to, that makes the artist.  The real schools\\nshould be the streets.  There is not, for instance, a single\\ndelicate line, or delightful proportion, in the dress of the\\nGreeks, which is not echoed exquisitely in their architecture.  A\\nnation arrayed in stove-pipe hats and dress-improvers might have\\nbuilt the Pantechnichon possibly, but the Parthenon never.  And\\nfinally, there is this to be said:  Art, it is true, can never have\\nany other claim but her own perfection, and it may be that the\\nartist, desiring merely to contemplate and to create, is wise in\\nnot busying himself about change in others:  yet wisdom is not\\nalways the best; there are times when she sinks to the level of\\ncommon-sense; and from the passionate folly of those--and there are\\nmany--who desire that Beauty shall be confined no longer to the\\nbric-a-brac of the collector and the dust of the museum, but shall\\nbe, as it should be, the natural and national inheritance of all,--\\nfrom this noble unwisdom, I say, who knows what new loveliness\\nshall be given to life, and, under these more exquisite conditions,\\nwhat perfect artist born?  Le milieu se renouvelant, l\\'art se\\nrenouvelle.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN INVASION\\n\\n\\n\\nA terrible danger is hanging over the Americans in London.  Their\\nfuture and their reputation this season depend entirely on the\\nsuccess of Buffalo Bill and Mrs. Brown-Potter.  The former is\\ncertain to draw; for English people are far more interested in\\nAmerican barbarism than they are in American civilization.  When\\nthey sight Sandy Hook they look to their rifles and ammunition;\\nand, after dining once at Delmonico\\'s, start off for Colorado or\\nCalifornia, for Montana or the Yellow Stone Park.  Rocky Mountains\\ncharm them more than riotous millionaires; they have been known to\\nprefer buffaloes to Boston.  Why should they not?  The cities of\\nAmerica are inexpressibly tedious.  The Bostonians take their\\nlearning too sadly; culture with them is an accomplishment rather\\nthan an atmosphere; their \"Hub,\" as they call it, is the paradise\\nof prigs.  Chicago is a sort of monster-shop, full of bustle and\\nbores.  Political life at Washington is like political life in a\\nsuburban vestry.  Baltimore is amusing for a week, but Philadelphia\\nis dreadfully provincial; and though one can dine in New York one\\ncould not dwell there.  Better the Far West with its grizzly bears\\nand its untamed cowboys, its free open-air life and its free open-\\nair manners, its boundless prairie and its boundless mendacity!\\nThis is what Buffalo Bill is going to bring to London; and we have\\nno doubt that London will fully appreciate his show.\\n\\nWith regard to Mrs. Brown-Potter, as acting is no longer considered\\nabsolutely essential for success on the English stage, there is\\nreally no reason why the pretty bright-eyed lady who charmed us all\\nlast June by her merry laugh and her nonchalant ways, should not--\\nto borrow an expression from her native language--make a big boom\\nand paint the town red.  We sincerely hope she will; for, on the\\nwhole, the American invasion has done English society a great deal\\nof good.  American women are bright, clever, and wonderfully\\ncosmopolitan.  Their patriotic feelings are limited to an\\nadmiration for Niagara and a regret for the Elevated Railway; and,\\nunlike the men, they never bore us with Bunkers Hill.  They take\\ntheir dresses from Paris and their manners from Piccadilly, and\\nwear both charmingly.  They have a quaint pertness, a delightful\\nconceit, a native self-assertion.  They insist on being paid\\ncompliments and have almost succeeded in making Englishmen\\neloquent.  For our aristocracy they have an ardent admiration; they\\nadore titles and are a permanent blow to Republican principles.  In\\nthe art of amusing men they are adepts, both by nature and\\neducation, and can actually tell a story without forgetting the\\npoint--an accomplishment that is extremely rare among the women of\\nother countries.  It is true that they lack repose and that their\\nvoices are somewhat harsh and strident when they land first at\\nLiverpool; but after a time one gets to love those pretty\\nwhirlwinds in petticoats that sweep so recklessly through society\\nand are so agitating to all duchesses who have daughters.  There is\\nsomething fascinating in their funny, exaggerated gestures and\\ntheir petulant way of tossing the head.  Their eyes have no magic\\nnor mystery in them, but they challenge us for combat; and when we\\nengage we are always worsted.  Their lips seem made for laughter\\nand yet they never grimace.  As for their voices they soon get them\\ninto tune.  Some of them have been known to acquire a fashionable\\ndrawl in two seasons; and after they have been presented to Royalty\\nthey all roll their R\\'s as vigorously as a young equerry or an old\\nlady-in-waiting.  Still, they never really lose their accent; it\\nkeeps peeping out here and there, and when they chatter together\\nthey are like a bevy of peacocks.  Nothing is more amusing than to\\nwatch two American girls greeting each other in a drawing-room or\\nin the Row.  They are like children with their shrill staccato\\ncries of wonder, their odd little exclamations.  Their conversation\\nsounds like a series of exploding crackers; they are exquisitely\\nincoherent and use a sort of primitive, emotional language.  After\\nfive minutes they are left beautifully breathless and look at each\\nother half in amusement and half in affection.  If a stolid young\\nEnglishman is fortunate enough to be introduced to them he is\\namazed at their extraordinary vivacity, their electric quickness of\\nrepartee, their inexhaustible store of curious catchwords.  He\\nnever really understands them, for their thoughts flutter about\\nwith the sweet irresponsibility of butterflies; but he is pleased\\nand amused and feels as if he were in an aviary.  On the whole,\\nAmerican girls have a wonderful charm and, perhaps, the chief\\nsecret of their charm is that they never talk seriously except\\nabout amusements.  They have, however, one grave fault--their\\nmothers.  Dreary as were those old Pilgrim Fathers who left our\\nshores more than two centuries ago to found a New England beyond\\nthe seas, the Pilgrim Mothers who have returned to us in the\\nnineteenth century are drearier still.\\n\\nHere and there, of course, there are exceptions, but as a class\\nthey are either dull, dowdy or dyspeptic.  It is only fair to the\\nrising generation of America to state that they are not to blame\\nfor this.  Indeed, they spare no pains at all to bring up their\\nparents properly and to give them a suitable, if somewhat late,\\neducation.  From its earliest years every American child spends\\nmost of its time in correcting the faults of its father and mother;\\nand no one who has had the opportunity of watching an American\\nfamily on the deck of an Atlantic steamer, or in the refined\\nseclusion of a New York boarding-house, can fail to have been\\nstruck by this characteristic of their civilization.  In America\\nthe young are always ready to give to those who are older than\\nthemselves the full benefits of their inexperience.  A boy of only\\neleven or twelve years of age will firmly but kindly point out to\\nhis father his defects of manner or temper; will never weary of\\nwarning him against extravagance, idleness, late hours,\\nunpunctuality, and the other temptations to which the aged are so\\nparticularly exposed; and sometimes, should he fancy that he is\\nmonopolizing too much of the conversation at dinner, will remind\\nhim, across the table, of the new child\\'s adage, \"Parents should be\\nseen, not heard.\"  Nor does any mistaken idea of kindness prevent\\nthe little American girl from censuring her mother whenever it is\\nnecessary.  Often, indeed, feeling that a rebuke conveyed in the\\npresence of others is more truly efficacious than one merely\\nwhispered in the quiet of the nursery, she will call the attention\\nof perfect strangers to her mother\\'s general untidiness, her want\\nof intellectual Boston conversation, immoderate love of iced water\\nand green corn, stinginess in the matter of candy, ignorance of the\\nusages of the best Baltimore Society, bodily ailments, and the\\nlike.  In fact, it may be truly said that no American child is ever\\nblind to the deficiencies of its parents, no matter how much it may\\nlove them.\\n\\nYet, somehow, this educational system has not been so successful as\\nit deserved.  In many cases, no doubt, the material with which the\\nchildren had to deal was crude and incapable of real development;\\nbut the fact remains that the American mother is a tedious person.\\nThe American father is better, for he is never seen in London.  He\\npasses his life entirely in Wall Street and communicates with his\\nfamily once a month by means of a telegram in cipher.  The mother,\\nhowever, is always with us, and, lacking the quick imitative\\nfaculty of the younger generation, remains uninteresting and\\nprovincial to the last.  In spite of her, however, the American\\ngirl is always welcome.  She brightens our dull dinner parties for\\nus and makes life go pleasantly by for a season.  In the race for\\ncoronets she often carries off the prize; but, once she has gained\\nthe victory, she is generous and forgives her English rivals\\neverything, even their beauty.\\n\\nWarned by the example of her mother that American women do not grow\\nold gracefully, she tries not to grow old at all and often\\nsucceeds.  She has exquisite feet and hands, is always bien\\nchaussee et bien gantee and can talk brilliantly upon any subject,\\nprovided that she knows nothing about it.\\n\\nHer sense of humour keeps her from the tragedy of a grande passion,\\nand, as there is neither romance nor humility in her love, she\\nmakes an excellent wife.  What her ultimate influence on English\\nlife will be it is difficult to estimate at present; but there can\\nbe no doubt that, of all the factors that have contributed to the\\nsocial revolution of London, there are few more important, and none\\nmore delightful, than the American Invasion.\\n\\n\\n\\nSERMONS IN STONES AT BLOOMSBURY\\nTHE NEW SCULPTURE ROOM AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough the exertions of Sir Charles Newton, to whom every student\\nof classic art should be grateful, some of the wonderful treasures\\nso long immured in the grimy vaults of the British Museum have at\\nlast been brought to light, and the new Sculpture Room now opened\\nto the public will amply repay the trouble of a visit, even from\\nthose to whom art is a stumbling-block and a rock of offence.  For\\nsetting aside the mere beauty of form, outline and mass, the grace\\nand loveliness of design and the delicacy of technical treatment,\\nhere we have shown to us what the Greeks and Romans thought about\\ndeath; and the philosopher, the preacher, the practical man of the\\nworld, and even the Philistine himself, cannot fail to be touched\\nby these \"sermons in stones,\" with their deep significance, their\\nfertile suggestion, their plain humanity.  Common tombstones they\\nare, most of them, the work not of famous artists but of simple\\nhandicraftsmen, only they were wrought in days when every\\nhandicraft was an art.  The finest specimens, from the purely\\nartistic point of view, are undoubtedly the two stelai found at\\nAthens.  They are both the tombstones of young Greek athletes.  In\\none the athlete is represented handing his strigil to his slave, in\\nthe other the athlete stands alone, strigil in hand.  They do not\\nbelong to the greatest period of Greek art, they have not the grand\\nstyle of the Phidian age, but they are beautiful for all that, and\\nit is impossible not to be fascinated by their exquisite grace and\\nby the treatment which is so simple in its means, so subtle in its\\neffect.  All the tombstones, however, are full of interest.  Here\\nis one of two ladies of Smyrna who were so remarkable in their day\\nthat the city voted them honorary crowns; here is a Greek doctor\\nexamining a little boy who is suffering from indigestion; here is\\nthe memorial of Xanthippus who, probably, was a martyr to gout, as\\nhe is holding in his hand the model of a foot, intended, no doubt,\\nas a votive offering to some god.  A lovely stele from Rhodes gives\\nus a family group.  The husband is on horseback and is bidding\\nfarewell to his wife, who seems as if she would follow him but is\\nbeing held back by a little child.  The pathos of parting from\\nthose we love is the central motive of Greek funeral art.  It is\\nrepeated in every possible form, and each mute marble stone seems\\nto murmur [Greek text].  Roman art is different.  It introduces\\nvigorous and realistic portraiture and deals with pure family life\\nfar more frequently than Greek art does.  They are very ugly, those\\nstern-looking Roman men and women whose portraits are exhibited on\\ntheir tombs, but they seem to have been loved and respected by\\ntheir children and their servants.  Here is the monument of\\nAphrodisius and Atilia, a Roman gentleman and his wife, who died in\\nBritain many centuries ago, and whose tombstone was found in the\\nThames; and close by it stands a stele from Rome with the busts of\\nan old married couple who are certainly marvellously ill-favoured.\\nThe contrast between the abstract Greek treatment of the idea of\\ndeath and the Roman concrete realization of the individuals who\\nhave died is extremely curious.\\n\\nBesides the tombstones, the new Sculpture Room contains some most\\nfascinating examples of Roman decorative art under the Emperors.\\nThe most wonderful of all, and this alone is worth a trip to\\nBloomsbury, is a bas-relief representing a marriage scene, Juno\\nPronuba is joining the hands of a handsome young noble and a very\\nstately lady.  There is all the grace of Perugino in this marble,\\nall the grace of Raphael even.  The date of it is uncertain, but\\nthe particular cut of the bridegroom\\'s beard seems to point to the\\ntime of the Emperor Hadrian.  It is clearly the work of Greek\\nartists and is one of the most beautiful bas-reliefs in the whole\\nMuseum.  There is something in it which reminds one of the music\\nand the sweetness of Propertian verse.  Then we have delightful\\nfriezes of children.  One representing children playing on musical\\ninstruments might have suggested much of the plastic art of\\nFlorence.  Indeed, as we view these marbles it is not difficult to\\nsee whence the Renaissance sprang and to what we owe the various\\nforms of Renaissance art.  The frieze of the Muses, each of whom\\nwears in her hair a feather plucked from the wings of the\\nvanquished sirens, is extremely fine; there is a lovely little bas-\\nrelief of two cupids racing in chariots; and the frieze of\\nrecumbent Amazons has some splendid qualities of design.  A frieze\\nof children playing with the armour of the god Mars should also be\\nmentioned.  It is full of fancy and delicate humour.\\n\\n We hope that some more of the hidden treasures will shortly be\\ncatalogued and shown.  In the vaults at present there is a very\\nremarkable bas-relief of the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, and\\nanother representing the professional mourners weeping over the\\nbody of the dead.  The fine cast of the Lion of Chaeronea should\\nalso be brought up, and so should the stele with the marvellous\\nportrait of the Roman slave.  Economy is an excellent public\\nvirtue, but the parsimony that allows valuable works of art to\\nremain in the grim and gloom of a damp cellar is little short of a\\ndetestable public vice.\\n\\n\\n\\nL\\'ENVOI\\n\\n\\n\\nAmongst the many young men in England who are seeking along with me\\nto continue and to perfect the English Renaissance--jeunes\\nguerriers du drapeau romantique, as Gautier would have called us--\\nthere is none whose love of art is more flawless and fervent, whose\\nartistic sense of beauty is more subtle and more delicate--none,\\nindeed, who is dearer to myself--than the young poet whose verses I\\nhave brought with me to America; verses full of sweet sadness, and\\nyet full of joy; for the most joyous poet is not he who sows the\\ndesolate highways of this world with the barren seed of laughter,\\nbut he who makes his sorrow most musical, this indeed being the\\nmeaning of joy in art--that incommunicable element of artistic\\ndelight which, in poetry, for instance, comes from what Keats\\ncalled \"sensuous life of verse,\" the element of song in the\\nsinging, made so pleasurable to us by that wonder of motion which\\noften has its origin in mere musical impulse, and in painting is to\\nbe sought for, from the subject never, but from the pictorial charm\\nonly--the scheme and symphony of the colour, the satisfying beauty\\nof the design:  so that the ultimate expression of our artistic\\nmovement in painting has been, not in the spiritual vision of the\\nPre-Raphaelites, for all their marvel of Greek legend and their\\nmystery of Italian song, but in the work of such men as Whistler\\nand Albert Moore, who have raised design and colour to the ideal\\nlevel of poetry and music.  For the quality of their exquisite\\npainting comes from the mere inventive and creative handling of\\nline and colour, from a certain form and choice of beautiful\\nworkmanship, which, rejecting all literary reminiscence and all\\nmetaphysical idea, is in itself entirely satisfying to the\\naesthetic sense--is, as the Greeks would say, an end in itself; the\\neffect of their work being like the effect given to us by music;\\nfor music is the art in which form and matter are always one--the\\nart whose subject cannot be separated from the method of its\\nexpression; the art which most completely realizes for us the\\nartistic ideal, and is the condition to which all the other arts\\nare constantly aspiring.\\n\\nNow, this increased sense of the absolutely satisfying value of\\nbeautiful workmanship, this recognition of the primary importance\\nof the sensuous element in art, this love of art for art\\'s sake, is\\nthe point in which we of the younger school have made a departure\\nfrom the teaching of Mr. Ruskin,--a departure definite and\\ndifferent and decisive.\\n\\nMaster indeed of the knowledge of all noble living and of the\\nwisdom of all spiritual things will he be to us ever, seeing that\\nit was he who by the magic of his presence and the music of his\\nlips taught us at Oxford that enthusiasm for beauty which is the\\nsecret of Hellenism, and that desire for creation which is the\\nsecret of life, and filled some of us, at least, with the lofty and\\npassionate ambition to go forth into far and fair lands with some\\nmessage for the nations and some mission for the world, and yet in\\nhis art criticism, his estimate of the joyous element of art, his\\nwhole method of approaching art, we are no longer with him; for the\\nkeystone to his aesthetic system is ethical always.  He would judge\\nof a picture by the amount of noble moral ideas it expresses; but\\nto us the channels by which all noble work in painting can touch,\\nand does touch, the soul are not those of truths of life or\\nmetaphysical truths.  To him perfection of workmanship seems but\\nthe symbol of pride, and incompleteness of technical resource the\\nimage of an imagination too limitless to find within the limits of\\nform its complete expression, or of love too simple not to stammer\\nin its tale.  But to us the rule of art is not the rule of morals.\\nIn an ethical system, indeed, of any gentle mercy good intentions\\nwill, one is fain to fancy, have their recognition; but of those\\nthat would enter the serene House of Beauty the question that we\\nask is not what they had ever meant to do, but what they have done.\\nTheir pathetic intentions are of no value to us, but their realized\\ncreations only.  Pour moi je prefere les poetes qui font des vers,\\nles medecins qui sachent guerir, les peintres qui sanchent peindre.\\n\\nNor, in looking at a work of art, should we be dreaming of what it\\nsymbolises, but rather loving it for what it is.  Indeed, the\\ntranscendental spirit is alien to the spirit of art.  The\\nmetaphysical mind of Asia may create for itself the monstrous and\\nmany-breasted idol, but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is\\nmost instinct with spiritual life which conforms most closely to\\nthe perfect facts of physical life also.  Nor, in its primary\\naspect, has a painting, for instance, any more spiritual message or\\nmeaning for us than a blue tile from the wall of Damascus, or a\\nHitzen vase.  It is a beautifully coloured surface, nothing more,\\nand affects us by no suggestion stolen from philosophy, no pathos\\npilfered from literature, no feeling filched from a poet, but by\\nits own incommunicable artistic essence--by that selection of truth\\nwhich we call style, and that relation of values which is the\\ndraughtsmanship of painting, by the whole quality of the\\nworkmanship, the arabesque of the design, the splendour of the\\ncolour, for these things are enough to stir the most divine and\\nremote of the chords which make music in our soul, and colour,\\nindeed, is of itself a mystical presence on things, and tone a kind\\nof sentiment . . . all these poems aim, as I said, at producing a\\npurely artistic effect, and have the rare and exquisite quality\\nthat belongs to work of that kind; and I feel that the entire\\nsubordination in our aesthetic movement of all merely emotional and\\nintellectual motives to the vital informing poetic principle is the\\nsurest sign of our strength.\\n\\nBut it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the\\naesthetic demands of the age:  there should be also about it, if it\\nis to give us any permanent delight, the impress of a distinct\\nindividuality.  Whatever work we have in the nineteenth century\\nmust rest on the two poles of personality and perfection.  And so\\nin this little volume, by separating the earlier and more simple\\nwork from the work that is later and stronger and possesses\\nincreased technical power and more artistic vision, one might weave\\nthese disconnected poems, these stray and scattered threads, into\\none fiery-coloured strand of life, noting first a boy\\'s mere\\ngladness of being young, with all its simple joy in field and\\nflower, in sunlight and in song, and then the bitterness of sudden\\nsorrow at the ending by Death of one of the brief and beautiful\\nfriendships of one\\'s youth, with all those unanswered lodgings and\\nquestionings unsatisfied by which we vex, so uselessly, the marble\\nface of death; the artistic contrast between the discontented\\nincompleteness of the spirit and the complete perfection of the\\nstyle that expresses it forming the chief element of the aesthetic\\ncharm of these particular poems;--and then the birth of Love, and\\nall the wonder and the fear and the perilous delight of one on\\nwhose boyish brows the little wings of love have beaten for the\\nfirst time; and the love-songs, so dainty and delicate, little\\nswallow-flights of music, and full of such fragrance and freedom\\nthat they might all be sung in the open air and across moving\\nwater; and then autumn, coming with its choirless woods and odorous\\ndecay and ruined loveliness, Love lying dead; and the sense of the\\nmere pity of it.\\n\\nOne might stop there, for from a young poet one should ask for no\\ndeeper chords of life than those that love and friendship make\\neternal for us; and the best poems in the volume belong clearly to\\na later time, a time when these real experiences become absorbed\\nand gathered up into a form which seems from such real experiences\\nto be the most alien and the most remote; when the simple\\nexpression of joy or sorrow suffices no longer, and lives rather in\\nthe stateliness of the cadenced metre, in the music and colour of\\nthe linked words, than in any direct utterance; lives, one might\\nsay, in the perfection of the form more than in the pathos of the\\nfeeling.  And yet, after the broken music of love and the burial of\\nlove in the autumn woods, we can trace that wandering among strange\\npeople, and in lands unknown to us, by which we try so pathetically\\nto heal the hurts of the life we know, and that pure and passionate\\ndevotion to Art which one gets when the harsh reality of life has\\ntoo suddenly wounded one, and is with discontent or sorrow marring\\none\\'s youth, just as often, I think, as one gets it from any\\nnatural joy of living; and that curious intensity of vision by\\nwhich, in moments of overmastering sadness and despair\\nungovernable, artistic things will live in one\\'s memory with a\\nvivid realism caught from the life which they help one to forget--\\nan old grey tomb in Flanders with a strange legend on it, making\\none think how, perhaps, passion does live on after death; a\\nnecklace of blue and amber beads and a broken mirror found in a\\ngirl\\'s grave at Rome, a marble image of a boy habited like Eros,\\nand with the pathetic tradition of a great king\\'s sorrow lingering\\nabout it like a purple shadow,--over all these the tired spirit\\nbroods with that calm and certain joy that one gets when one has\\nfound something that the ages never dull and the world cannot harm;\\nand with it comes that desire of Greek things which is often an\\nartistic method of expressing one\\'s desire for perfection; and that\\nlonging for the old dead days which is so modern, so incomplete, so\\ntouching, being, in a way, the inverted torch of Hope, which burns\\nthe hand it should guide; and for many things a little sadness, and\\nfor all things a great love; and lastly, in the pinewood by the\\nsea, once more the quick and vital pulse of joyous youth leaping\\nand laughing in every line, the frank and fearless freedom of wave\\nand wind waking into fire life\\'s burnt-out ashes and into song the\\nsilent lips of pain,--how clearly one seems to see it all, the long\\ncolonnade of pines with sea and sky peeping in here and there like\\na flitting of silver; the open place in the green, deep heart of\\nthe wood with the little moss-grown altar to the old Italian god in\\nit; and the flowers all about, cyclamen in the shadowy places, and\\nthe stars of the white narcissus lying like snow-flakes over the\\ngrass, where the quick, bright-eyed lizard starts by the stone, and\\nthe snake lies coiled lazily in the sun on the hot sand, and\\noverhead the gossamer floats from the branches like thin, tremulous\\nthreads of gold,--the scene is so perfect for its motive, for\\nsurely here, if anywhere, the real gladness of life might be\\nrevealed to one\\'s youth--the gladness that comes, not from the\\nrejection, but from the absorption, of all passion, and is like\\nthat serene calm that dwells in the faces of the Greek statues, and\\nwhich despair and sorrow cannot touch, but intensify only.\\n\\nIn some such way as this we could gather up these strewn and\\nscattered petals of song into one perfect rose of life, and yet,\\nperhaps, in so doing, we might be missing the true quality of the\\npoems; one\\'s real life is so often the life that one does not lead;\\nand beautiful poems, like threads of beautiful silks, may be woven\\ninto many patterns and to suit many designs, all wonderful and all\\ndifferent:  and romantic poetry, too, is essentially the poetry of\\nimpressions, being like that latest school of painting, the school\\nof Whistler and Albert Moore, in its choice of situation as opposed\\nto subject; in its dealing with the exceptions rather than with the\\ntypes of life; in its brief intensity; in what one might call its\\nfiery-coloured momentariness, it being indeed the momentary\\nsituations of life, the momentary aspects of nature, which poetry\\nand painting new seek to render for us.  Sincerity and constancy\\nwill the artist, indeed, have always; but sincerity in art is\\nmerely that plastic perfection of execution without which a poem or\\na painting, however noble its sentiment or human its origin, is but\\nwasted and unreal work, and the constancy of the artist cannot be\\nto any definite rule or system of living, but to that principle of\\nbeauty only through which the inconstant shadows of his life are in\\ntheir most fleeting moment arrested and made permanent.  He will\\nnot, for instance, in intellectual matters acquiesce in that facile\\northodoxy of our day which is so reasonable and so artistically\\nuninteresting, nor yet will he desire that fiery faith of the\\nantique time which, while it intensified, yet limited the vision;\\nstill less will he allow the calm of his culture to be marred by\\nthe discordant despair of doubt or the sadness of a sterile\\nscepticism; for the Valley Perilous, where ignorant armies clash by\\nnight, is no resting-place meet for her to whom the gods have\\nassigned the clear upland, the serene height, and the sunlit air,--\\nrather will he be always curiously testing new forms of belief,\\ntinging his nature with the sentiment that still lingers about some\\nbeautiful creeds, and searching for experience itself, and not for\\nthe fruits of experience; when he has got its secret, he will leave\\nwithout regret much that was once very precious to him.  \"I am\\nalways insincere,\" says Emerson somewhere, \"as knowing that there\\nare other moods\":  \"Les emotions,\" wrote Theophile Gautier once in\\na review of Arsene Houssaye, \"Les emotions, ne se ressemblent pas,\\nmais etre emu--voila l\\'important.\"\\n\\nNow, this is the secret of the art of the modern romantic school,\\nand gives one the right keynote for its apprehension; but the real\\nquality of all work which, like Mr. Rodd\\'s, aims, as I said, at a\\npurely artistic effect, cannot be described in terms of\\nintellectual criticism; it is too intangible for that.  One can\\nperhaps convey it best in terms of the other arts, and by reference\\nto them; and, indeed, some of these poems are as iridescent and as\\nexquisite as a lovely fragment of Venetian glass; others as\\ndelicate in perfect workmanship and as single in natural motive as\\nan etching by Whistler is, or one of those beautiful little Greek\\nfigures which in the olive woods round Tanagra men can still find,\\nwith the faint gilding and the fading crimson not yet fled from\\nhair and lips and raiment; and many of them seem like one of\\nCorot\\'s twilights just passing into music; for not merely in\\nvisible colour, but in sentiment also--which is the colour of\\npoetry--may there be a kind of tone.\\n\\nBut I think that the best likeness to the quality of this young\\npoet\\'s work I ever saw was in the landscape by the Loire.  We were\\nstaying once, he and I, at Amboise, that little village with its\\ngrey slate roofs and steep streets and gaunt, grim gateway, where\\nthe quiet cottages nestle like white pigeons into the sombre clefts\\nof the great bastioned rock, and the stately Renaissance houses\\nstand silent and apart--very desolate now, but with some memory of\\nthe old days still lingering about the delicately-twisted pillars,\\nand the carved doorways, with their grotesque animals, and laughing\\nmasks, and quaint heraldic devices, all reminding one of a people\\nwho could not think life real till they had made it fantastic.  And\\nabove the village, and beyond the bend of the river, we used to go\\nin the afternoon, and sketch from one of the big barges that bring\\nthe wine in autumn and the wood in winter down to the sea, or lie\\nin the long grass and make plans pour la gloire, et pour ennuyer\\nles Philistins, or wander along the low, sedgy banks, \"matching our\\nreeds in sportive rivalry,\" as comrades used in the old Sicilian\\ndays; and the land was an ordinary land enough, and bare, too, when\\none thought of Italy, and how the oleanders were robing the\\nhillsides by Genoa in scarlet, and the cyclamen filling with its\\npurple every valley from Florence to Rome; for there was not much\\nreal beauty, perhaps, in it, only long, white dusty roads and\\nstraight rows of formal poplars; but, now and then, some little\\nbreaking gleam of broken light would lend to the grey field and the\\nsilent barn a secret and a mystery that were hardly their own,\\nwould transfigure for one exquisite moment the peasants passing\\ndown through the vineyard, or the shepherd watching on the hill,\\nwould tip the willows with silver and touch the river into gold;\\nand the wonder of the effect, with the strange simplicity of the\\nmaterial, always seemed to me to be a little like the quality of\\nthese the verses of my friend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Shorter Prose Pieces by Oscar Wilde\\n']"
